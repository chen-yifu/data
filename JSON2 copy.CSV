corndogworm,,"So I’m gonna start this off by saying that I haven’t had my MRIs yet. But they’re already calling this a demylineating disease. 

I saw the neurologist for the first time in September. I had about a week and a half of numbness in my right arm and two days of numbness in my right leg after I looked down too quickly at work. They gave me an emg and told me all was normal and to come back if the symptoms happened again. 

So two weeks ago I had been getting raging headaches up until now. I’m not a headache person but they were there and definitely hard to ignore. Throw in a little bit of double vision and I still wasn’t concerned. However, last week while still getting the headaches, I woke up with the worst stiff neck I could ever imagine. It didn’t let up for 5 days. As soon as the neck happened, my numb arm and face came back with a vengeance. 

Yesterday I figured I might as well follow up with neuro so they took me in that day. I ended up seeing a nurse practitioner that works under the neuro who did my EMG. During this visit she said I had a positive babinski result that I hadn’t had back in September. As we were going over everything and doing the exam, she said that she wants to do a brain MRI and left the exam room to consult neurologist. He was pretty loud when he was speaking and he told her “sounds like MS. Don’t tell her it is so she doesn’t freak out but do a brain and neck MRI with and without contrast.” 

She came back in and told me she thinks it’s a demylineating disease and said that my symptoms sound like MS but they just want to make sure before they say for sure. So now I’m waiting for insurance to approve the MRIs. 

I’m so afraid and I don’t want to freak out my husband so I haven’t really talked to him about it. Just told him about the MRIs. I wish they didn’t act so definitive without imaging me yet. I’m only 21. Queue depression mode.",1579710440,17,Array,Array
fione_,"30F/RRMS DxJan2007/Ocrevus","Hello!! I hope you are all having a nice week.

I am wondering, for those of you that practice intermittent fasting (I.F.)- How do you ensure you are not becoming malnourished, without going for blood work nonstop?

My question comes from the fact that I'm having a lot of issues around food. I am thin, but not underweight (BMI 18.5-19) and have a bit of a hard time keeping healthy weight on as I have very little appetite.

Only last week I regained my sense of taste/feeling in my mouth. I didn't ever really consciously get started with I.F., I just don't eat a lot and don't know if I'm actually doing more harm than good. 

I know I am quite B12 deficient and am overdue for a B12 shot (I self-inject this normally every month, but am still low), and also have very low Vitamin D but take supplements of that and omega 3s.

My diet looks like this in an average week:
-Black coffee (2-3 cups) and water every morning 
-Smoothie made with rice milk, tahini, berries and protein powder normally about 4 days/week.
-Snack around noon: Sunripe fruit-to-go bar
-I might have avocado on gluten free toast with butter or GF macaroni and cheese 3x/week
-Dinners: Baked Chicken (seasoned with indian spices), roasted veggies (carrots, onion, sweet potato, zucchini) and rice or GF potato gnocchi, or I'll order a GF pepperoni pizza about twice/month.

3-4 days/week I'll have some dark chocolate and/or some potato chips in the evening.

I know the things I am eating are generally healthy, I'm just afraid it's too far. *So I'm asking, is there anything that stands out that could be an easy change?*

Do you have any healthy and easy go-to meals that help lift you up and keep you sustained? 

I'm looking for suggestions for real foods and simple recipes. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! Thanks!",1579723236,5,Array,Array
