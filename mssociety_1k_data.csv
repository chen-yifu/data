0,New to MS," Firstly I'm relieved to know that there is a forum such as this for people suffering with MS can turn to and I want to use this time to also introduce myself, my name is Kelly I'm 34 and live on Newcastle in the north east. I have recently been diagnosed with relapse and remission type MS - and I'm waiting next week to speak to my specialist team. Atthe time of learning about my diagnosiswas so crushing. That said,I have also become a new mamfor the first time a year ago which is the best experienceof my life to date. Admittedly though there has been a lot of times where I have found myself worrying about what my future holds and if I can remain a good parent to my daughter Matilda. I guess these are questions any new mum asks themselves, however, I find myself questioning my abilities for different reasons. I am extremely lucky that I have a loving and supportive family and friends (who have been amazing)including a marvellous husband,so I will never be alone or lack people to talk to. I mainly wanted to know how others found hearing theirdiagnoses made them feel, I am really struggling at the moment and have had to seek help to cope with negative thoughts and feelings towards myselfby going tocounsellingand attending talking therapy/CBTsessions. Did others find these helpful when dealing with anxiety and low moods?

2,New to MS," Hi, Im new to this group. Im not diagnosed yet awaiting more tests! I believe Ive had a bout of optic neuritis in July last year but Ive been to several opticians/ ophthalmologists who are all telling me I havent. Ive had a brain mri in August which was clear, but i know that doesnt rule ms out. I have tingling and numbness and my eye still isnt back to normal. My gp thinks its anxiety, which I do agree I have as my mom passed away in April last year and then in July my partner was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour, but Im not convinced anxiety can cause all these symptoms. I had a problem about 7 years ago with my vision too, so I think that was the start of it. 
Has anyone else had a similar experience with being told its not optic neuritis when they have all the symptoms??

3,Absolutely Petrified!!!," Hi,  As per my title I am absolutely petrified right now and convinced I have all the symptoms of MS.   About 10 days ago I noticed that I was getting numbness in my left foot which carried on for a few days and continued on and off up my leg. On Friday I woke up in the middle of the night and was completely numb down my left side which freaked me out and I took myself to A&amp;E where I had a CT scan and some blood tests before being admitted to the stroke ward as the only thing they could think of was that I had a possible minor stroke. They advised I needed an MRI scan however as it was now the weekend and I wouldn't be able to have onethey felt they could discharge me and have one as an urgent outpatient which I am having this weekend.  My symptoms currently are a strange feeling in my left leg including on and off pins and needles and numbness. When I first noticed this I also had pins and needles in my face and felt like I was dribbling as well as having issues on a couple of occasions getting my words out.Over the last couple of days my feet particularly my left one has been freezing cold also. My left buttock is also numb and sorry to much information but I feel like the left side of my vagina is too. I do not think I have had a stroke as I did not loose strength at all.   ive obviously been checking my symptoms online and convinced I have MS which is scaring me!! I don't know what to do. I expect I need to wait for my head MRI on Sunday and the results as this should pick up possible ms?   sorry I just need to talk to someone,    thank you, Jo ","<p>Hi,</p><p>As per my title I am absolutely petrified right now and convinced I have all the symptoms of MS.<br></p><p>About 10 days ago I noticed that I was getting numbness in my left foot which carried on for a few days and continued on and off up my leg.

I'm sorry, I can't answer your question...but I also have vision problems that come and go. I was diagnosed with relapsing MS only a few weeks ago.

I'm hoping to ask this question when I see my neurologist next month.

10,MS doesnt usually cause stiffness in joints?," I was diagnosed with ""active""MS at the start of December, waiting for an appointment to see the MS nurse since then to discuss treatment suggested by consultant.Have had to chase to even get confirmation that an appointment will be happening at some point soon. I contacted the MSnurse via email,since none of the phone numbers I've been given are everanswered, to ask if there would be an appointment soon and to say my ankleshave been constantly stiff since for weeks now  The reply I got consisted of two sentences, the first saying you'll ""probably have an appointment in February"" and the second saying that ""MS doesn't usually cause stiffness in joints, maybe get your Gp to check it out"". Is that correct? I'm trying to be so careful not to read too much into everything but now I'm worried I won't be taken seriously if I mention anything.I'm overweight and in the past it hasbeen used as excuse by GP (thankfullynot my current one) to not be listened to.

I'm also worried I have brain fog often and nobody really believes me because I can't communicate the issue well to folk, even those I know.I find myself losing words and it's stressful.

11,MS doesnt usually cause stiffness in joints?," Hi Miss H , 
Just wanted to reply and reach out to you to say youre not going mad . I was diagnosed with highly active rrms in feb 2007 (although I can track symptoms back to 2004). 
In August 2011 I had a massive relapse and I had chronic stiffness and intense pain in my knees. I still suffer with this today , although its much better than what it was. My knees get very stiff and dont bend easily, and I can only stand for about 10 minutes, any longer and I experience achey joints. Ive mentioned this to my neurologist, MS nurse and my GP , and they all fob me off saying ms doesnt cause joint problems or pain ??? 
Ive had blood tests to see if I might have rheumatoid arthritis but this comes back negative with a negative ANA test. Im absolutely fed up with doctors giving me their text book answers. I know of other people who have experienced joint pains with their ms.   I also get cramping and tightness in my feet , sometimes they feel like their in a tight vice and I cant flex my foot freely (if that makes any sense lol !)  Anyway just wanted to say youre not on your own , good luck with starting treatment etc.  ","<p>Hi Miss H ,<br>

17,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI," As some of you know, I often answer posts on here asking for help to understand what a neurologists letter or radiologists report means. What you probably dont know is that it is a pretty time-consuming task and, every time I find myself typing the same stuff, I say to myself, I absolutely must put something together that I can copy and paste from!  Well, I have finally done it :-)  It occurred to me that some of you might be interested in reading the whole thing and that you might use it as a starter for 10, to give you more confidence to go and do some research on your own when you come across something in a letter or report that doesnt make any sense.  Ill still be happy to help, especially as the stuff Im posting here only really scratches the surface, so dont take this as me telling everyone to start doing it on their own :-)  I think the whole document is too long to post in one go, so Im going to do a reply below this about the brain and a reply after that about MRI. My apologies  the spinal cord is noticeable by its absence. Maybe Ill add something about that at a later date.  A couple of caveats. I have made this as easy as I could. That means that an expert would no doubt shake their head at bits and laugh their heads off at other bits, but on the whole I think its an acceptable explanation. However, I am not a neurologist or a radiologist; my knowledge comes from a background of neuroscience research using MRI followed by a lot of self teaching. In other words, please dont assume that this is fault-free!  I hope you find it helpful.  Karen x  PS This would never make a best seller list - prepare to be rather bored!!!

19,Are my symptoms MS?," Good morning all, just joined as I would like your thoughts on my history of symptoms and current ones.  About 5 years ago at the age of 52, I had a very strange sensation in my thigh, just like someone was hugging it tightly.  At the same time I developed one heck of a flue type bug which took me 4 months to recover from  During this period I was experiencing strange numbness in my legs and back, after around a year those symptoms diminished.  The next symptoms I started with were severe dizzy spells,which I still get but not as often or as bad.  Then I started getting electric shocks in my brain, like a thousand little shocks for a second or two.  Next symptom to develop was a hearing issue, I started to become very sensitive to certain noises, which can be very painful.  The next symptoms to appear was I lost my sense of smell.  Recently and the reason I started to research all of these symptoms is now wake up everyday aching all over.  Dr's have investigated all these over the last few years and are unable to offer me any explanation, although they did say when I had the flu symptoms/strange leg and back problem I may have had an infection of the spinal chord.  I haven't yet discussed the body aches as this has only appeared about a month ago  I am now approaching 57 and do like to keep fit at the gym  So my current issues are super sensitive hearing, odd hearing, loss of sense of smell, body aching all over, slight dizzy spells.

20,Looking for some guidance...," So I'm sick of googling and searching so I'm coming to the experts.. Here's my symptoms. I want to see it this is similar to anyone else that has been diagnosed or not. Starting in April of 2019 I started having dizzy spells. Not like spinning, just feeling a little off balance. I went to my GP and she contributed it to hormones (I was a few months post partumat that point.)A couple months later I started having pressure in my ears and behind my nose at times. I went back and she thought it was my inner ear. Told me to take Claritin and Flonase which I did. The dizziness subsided when I take these religiously. Then in October I started having trouble focusing when I was driving or riding in a car. It also happened when I was in big dept stores. Went to an optometrist where my eyes were dilated. I was told I had great vision and the back of my eyes looked very healthy. Well, 3 weeks ago I started having tingling (pins and needles)pop up at random areas in my body. They last a few minutes and stop. Usually moving to a different area. At that time it was in my hands and arms bilaterally and on my face. Went back to GP and she found my BP was elevated and put me on a BP Med and some Prozac for anxiety. The Prozac makes my anxiety worse so I'm not taking it right now. The tingling wentaway for 3 weeks and now it's back in my hands and feet. Happens for a few minutes then goes away, coming back shortly after.. Seems much worse if I'm concentrating on it.Of course I'm googling every single symptom I'm having and every time something about MS comes up. I'm driving myself crazy and I feel like I'm being dismissed by my doctor. Does this sound like how anyone else's MS started?Thanks in advance and sorry this is so long.

25,I'm so confused," I'm at a weird sort of crossroads right now and I know no one here can do much except maybe give me their experiences. Which I think might give me some real insight.    I'm having to wait for a few months to see a neurologist, but the possibility for MS was floated about by my GP. And I won't go into the long story of it all, but I know some of my symptoms match MS, but they also match Functional Neurological Disorder (although the page that I was sent to for that by my GP, that would also match IBS, it's a very confusing condition as well)  Everything right now isall a vague mess that I just have to wait months in a purgatoryto find out what's going on.   And it's hard to find experiences that really define the differences between the two. LIke MS Hug, is what this feels like actually MS hug (I have a severe pain on the right side of my chest, like it's pressing in on my right breast and chest plate all day long)or is it just fibro pain that has suddenly got worse? Not to get too much into it, but they suggested the neuropathic pain in my legs and hands was a lack of B12, but I take B12 every day and it has only gotten worse. So is this the same as MS? Or do patients with MS feel something different than FND? And do you also have an uptick in shooting pains before a muscle spasm (at night I can feel them coming on, I know they're going to start, I get more severe stabbing/shooting pains and then my leg will start jumping, and then the pain will come, quick succession, like the muscle is twisting, then it stiffens up horribly even as it's spasming, but it's always proceeded by that uptick in shooting pains).  If anyone could just give me some of their experiences with things like the MS Hug, leg spasms or stiffness, neuropathic pain, weakness (for me it's like walking through thick oatmeal), trouble swallowing (sometimes food just dribbles out of my mouth, or it gets stuck in my throat and I have to make myself throw up so I can get it out), anything really...I would be forever grateful. I feel like I'm going crazy here and the doctors are trying their hardest, I know, but I feel so alone in this.   And I know I'm not technically diagnosed, it's hanging over my head as a possibility right now.

Which I think might give me some real insight.</p><p></p><p>I'm having to wait for a few months to see a neurologist, but the possibility for MS was floated about by my GP. And I won't go into the long story of it all, but I know some of my symptoms match MS, but they also match Functional Neurological Disorder (although the page that I was sent to for that by my GP, that would also match IBS, it's a very confusing condition as well)</p><p>Everything right now isall a vague mess that I just have to wait months in a purgatoryto find out what's going on. </p><p>And it's hard to find experiences that really define the differences between the two. LIke MS Hug, is what this feels like actually MS hug (I have a severe pain on the right side of my chest, like it's pressing in on my right breast and chest plate all day long)or is it just fibro pain that has suddenly got worse? Not to get too much into it, but they suggested the neuropathic pain in my legs and hands was a lack of B12, but I take B12 every day and it has only gotten worse. So is this the same as MS? Or do patients with MS feel something different than FND? And do you also have an uptick in shooting pains before a muscle spasm (at night I can feel them coming on, I know they're going to start, I get more severe stabbing/shooting pains and then my leg will start jumping, and then the pain will come, quick succession, like the muscle is twisting, then it stiffens up horribly even as it's spasming, but it's always proceeded by that uptick in shooting pains).</p><p>If anyone could just give me some of their experiences with things like the MS Hug, leg spasms or stiffness, neuropathic pain, weakness (for me it's like walking through thick oatmeal), trouble swallowing (sometimes food just dribbles out of my mouth, or it gets stuck in my throat and I have to make myself throw up so I can get it out), anything really...I would be forever grateful. I feel like I'm going crazy here and the doctors are trying their hardest, I know, but I feel so alone in this. </p><p>And I know I'm not technically diagnosed, it's hanging over my head as a possibility right now. I just hope to go in more educated about the differences between the two conditions and whether my symptomsfits FND or MS better. </p>",27 Dec  2019 at 11:26 am,#1,86975,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/forums/new-diagnosis-and-diagnosis/im-so-confused,toolofanxiety,,,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/users/toolofanxiety,,,

30,Questions about steroids for relapse," Hello there,  I have been diagnosed with probable MS, although neuro said it will end up sooner or later as definite. Last week I suddenly had a relapse and was prescribed a 5 day course of steroids (500mg each day). Certainly sorted out the overwhelming fatigue (insomnia city!), but physical symptoms still there.  My questions are, when I stop the steroids in 2 days time, will the fatigue return? Is it normal for a relapse to come completely out of the blue? And as i have a positive MRI, positive lumbar puncture and a CIS, is this relapse the final piece in the jigsaw?? Very confusing!  I posted on here before and I found the comments really useful, so thank you!

31,Questions about steroids for relapse,"  I'm afraid the return of the fatigue is quite likely        Steroids make a lot of people temporarily hyper, but it's usually short-lived. Of course, the fatigue may have been mainly to do with the relapse in which case, if the steroids have reduced the inflammation, they may have reduced the fatigue too. Let's hope so!      Unfortunately, yes, relapses can come suddenly out of the blue. I think most relapses come on more gradually (maybe over a day or two), but they can just suddenly be there too.       Whether or not this relapse means that your diagnosis will be confirmed depends on why the neuro didn't confirm it already. Probable MS means that you either hadn't had multiple relapses or that you didn't have multiple lesion locations (or sufficient lesions on MRI vs the criteria). If your MRI met the criteria, but you had only had one relapse previously, then yes, this relapse will probably mean that your dx will be changed to MS.       I hope the steroids do the trick and speed up your recovery :-)      Karen x  ","<p><span>I'm afraid the return of the fatigue is quite likely <img alt=""letdown"" height=""35"" src=""http://www.mssociety.org.uk/sites/all/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/LetDown.png"" width=""35""></span></p><p></p><p><span>Steroids make a lot of people temporarily hyper, but it's usually short-lived.

32,Lesions but clear lumbar," Hi all, I am new to this forum but hoping others experiences can help me to understand where my diagnosis is going.  In a short recap of my medical history, have had pins and needles in my hands and feet for a number of years, was initially told it was carpol tunnel. However symptoms got worse over the years and ended up with numbness in my arms, heavy feeling in all limbs, falling over all the time and dropping everything.  Went back to my docs and had nerve conduction tests - neuro surgeon said that there was slowness in signal but based on other symptoms he wanted to refer me to neurologist.  I had a great neurologist who I explained all symptoms to - she asked lots of questions and did a few tests there and then and then instantly sent me for an MRI scan. MRI confirmed lesions on the brain. I had of course started to google symptoms and by this time was pretty sure myself that it was MS. Neurologist then sent me for lumbar puncture. Her words were "" i am almost 100% sure this is MS but want to do a lumbar puncture to connect all the dots""  After the most horrendous lumbar puncture procedure (almost 4hours bent over whilst they tried to get the tap in) my GP and I received a letter from another neurologist who said that lumbar was clear and that he did not believe it was MS. He advised that migraines I had had as a teen (i m now 38) were the cause of the lesions and that the symptoms I was currently experiencing are secondary to the migraines. This neuro has never seen me and has written off the diagnosis my first neurohad provided based on lumbar only. It turns out my old neurololgist has now left and this other guy is my new point of contact.  As I said i had migraines in my teens but they are very rare now. I now get headache pain at the back of my head near my neck and my eyes are sensitive esp to the light) but not like with a migraine.  I was devastated (i thought i was close to getting some help and support) and went back to my doctors. The dr was furious that this neuro could make this diagnosis without even seeing me and has written to him to say so. I have a follow up appt in Feb, where I am taking a full diary of my symptoms that I am having on a daily basis in the hopes that I can prove to him that my symptoms are not secondary, but are life changing.  I have had to change my car so that I have an automatic with adaptive cruise control as my legs go numb if i drive for too long. I can't do the weekly shop anymore as I get too tired, I can't walk my dogs or run in the park with my kids as i get too tired. I cut my hands and burn myself on the oven most days as I do not feel the heat and I have dropped more crockery and glasses in the last year I have lost count. If anything is on the side my arms are like a magnet and seem to knock it off!! I can't walk up the stairs to my bedroom without feeling exhausted at the end of it......These symptoms are not in my head and have changed and are changing my life all the time.  Has anyone else had mri showing lesions and then a clear lumbar? I just don't know where to go from here  (sorry that wasn't short at all was it!)

34,Lesions but clear lumbar," Hello  What a horrible time you've been having. Quite how a neurologist can rule MS out on the basis of a lumbar puncture, I don't know. Have a look at https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/lumbar-puncture The MS Trust provide reliable information so can be trusted. Within this webpage, it explains that 80 to 95% of people with MS test positive forOligoclonalbands on their lumbar puncture. Forgive my maths, but Iread this as up to 20% of people with MS test negative.  So testing negative for one test isn't the same as testing negative for MS (unless it's a complete head and full spineMRIscan).  I don't know if you should take this as positive news of not. Many people would find it more frightening than reassuring. But if you've suffered symptom after symptom that could be explained by one diagnosis, failing to be diagnosed is more fearful than being diagnosed.  I think that having a complete diary to take with you to your next appointment is a good plan. Don't expect to be able to go through absolutely every symptoms one by one. Your neurologist will have his own way of conducting an examination. So long as he does a physical examination you shouldn'thave too much to worry about. He will have your previousneurological examination,MRIexaminations, other test results and his own examination to go by in addition to your history.  You may want to keep in mind the McDonald Criteria for diagnosing MS. Have a look at https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/lumbar-puncture This states that for MS diagnosis, what's needed is dissemination in time and place.

Moderators work 9.30am  5pm, Monday to Friday. If you post during an evening or weekend, well moderate your post first thing on the next working day.  Our sincere apologies that we cant instantly publish new users posts. Weve agonised long and hard about this. Without thesechecks, the amount ofspamposted on the forums makes them practically unusable.     How do I create a new post?   To create a new post, simply click on the category board which is relevant to your post. At the top of that page, you will see the New Thread button. Click this button, add your title and post. Please note, if you're a new user - your first three posts will need approval before they are published (see; I'm a new user, why are my postsare not published instantly?)     How do I get in touch with a moderator?   The forum is monitored by a number of moderators, this is to help ensure that the forum remains a friendly, secure and valuable space for all members. If you have a query, suggestion or need help using the forum, you can reach the team via:  communityteam@mssociety.org.uk  , alternatively you can also private message Oliver - Admin should you need help.     How do I edit my profile settings?   From 'My Homepage' you can edit your profile settings;change avatar, location details, whatyou're interested in etcby clicking 'My Profile'. Please ensure you save the changes for these to update.      What does this abbreviation mean?   For a list of abbreviationsused on the forum, please use this link &gt; https://community.mssociety.org.uk/forum/everyday-living/abbreviations-p...      Can I change the display settings?   Yes, If you click the ""accessibility"" link at the bottom of the page or go to http://www.mssociety.org.uk/accessibilityyou  can change the background colour to a high or low contrast option or a low graphics version of the site.     How do I receive email alerts for threads?   Get email alerts for individual posts by clicking ""subscribe"" at the bottom of the original post on each thread.     What is 'my favourites'?   Its a feature that allows you to save posts from the forum to your favourites list. Under the original post at the top of each thread theres an add to favourites link. Click this and the post will appear in the my favourites list on the right hand side of the page when youre in the forum (remember this block doesnt appear on individual posts  see above).  To delete a post from your favourites, click the X next to the title in the my favourites list.     Mobile Devices   The forum itself, although accessible on mobile devices (smart phones,iPadsand Android tablets) is a desktop site, meaning it has been built for use on a computer or laptop. Its not an app and unfortunately, its not entirely mobile compatible. Were aware that tablets and mobiles are increasingly peoples web browsing tool of choice and were working towards accommodating that.     Private messages and buddies   There are blocks on the right hand side of the page when youre logged in that link directly to your private messages and buddy lists. You can also access your private messages via my homepage. Please note if you havent yet added any buddies the my buddies block will not appear on the page.  These only show when youre on the forum homepage or the listing page for an individual board but not when youre looking at a forum post. This is because a lot of people asked for posts to cover the whole width of the screen so they didnt have to scroll so much when looking through them.     How do I protectmy identity from the real world and my online identity from other forum users   To hide your identity please choose a login id that is suitably anonymous (i.e. Not your real name, or email address) and be selective about the personal details you post to the system (see also: user control panel)  To hide your on-line name from other forum users when posting, check the box labelled  Post anon (Hide my username from other posters). This way you can post about something extra sensitive or personal without revealing anything else about yourself, even your username.  Please use the Post anon facility responsibly.     Tags   We have a system for tagging posts to allow you to categorise them by topic and also tofilterthe forum to see only posts on a particular topic or topics.  When youre writing a new post, remember to tick the most relevant box or boxes to what youre posting about. This will mean others will see your post when theyfilterthe forum to show posts about that topic.  Tagging your posts also means we can signpost people to the forum from the rest of thewebsite. We can pull titles of forum posts into related forum posts lists on relevant pages.  For example, we might set it up so the titles of posts tagged with emotional support appear a page about coping with diagnosis. Someone looking at that page would then immediately know that theres a community here that knows what theyre going through and can give them the help and support they need.     User control panel   Access everything to do with your account and your profile via  my homepage  (link in the top right corner of the page). My homepage has a link to my account where you can manage your username, password, email address and personal details and my profile where you can upload an avatar and also fill in and edit your profile.

61,Embarrasing Problem," Yes I too enjoy ultra urgency on occasion. It had a significant impact on my life. My MS nurse referred me to a continence specialist (which was never on my wish list) The specialist was great and very sensitive in dealing with me. She explained that the signalling system from bowel to brain is compromised, so the message to ""go"" is not received until nearly too late.  She suggested trying Peristeen, this is a self administered sort of enema. By putting water into the lower bowel it increases pressure to tissue which then sends signals to the brain to let go of the rubbish. This might sound bizarre but it enables me to be pretty confident that I will not get caught out. So before appointments or meetings with friends I can take a bit of control and comfortable about going out.  You are right, it is not the greatest subject of conversation, but with the right support it should not restrict your life.  I hope you can get something to help you out as well.

It happens a lot, but is more severe after a tablet. I am considering stopping taking them, but worried it will have a detriment on me!

89,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI,"   The brain    The brain has three main parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum and the brain stem. The cerebrum is the big part on the top which most people think of as the brain. The cerebellum is the smaller, roundish part that lies underneath the back of the cerebrum. The brain stem is the part that joins the brain to the spinal cord. It lies underneath the cerebrum, in front of the cerebellum and is at the top of the spinal cord.  The brain has three main types of matter, i.e. stuff. Gray matter is the stuff that does all the processing, encoding and storage  basically the thinking. White matter is the stuff that carries the signals between different parts of gray matter. If you imagine your phone connected to your computer via a USB cable, the phone and the computer are different parts of gray matter and the USB cable is the white matter allowing them to communicate with each other. Gray and white matter are made up of billions of neurons, or nerves: gray matter contains the main bodies of the nerves and white matter contains the tails of the nerves, called axons. Nerves that need to transmit fast signals have a myelin coating on their axons.  The third type of matter is CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). It bathes the brain, cushioning it and providing nourishment. There are reservoirs of CSF in the brain, the contents of which are continually refreshed by our bodies. These reservoirs are called ventricles. The biggest of these are called the lateral ventricles. If you slice the head from the eyes to the back of the skull and look down at it, you will see the lateral ventricles, one on either side of the line down the middle of the cerebrum, looking a bit like a butterfly.  Humans have evolved to have a lot of brain matter, so the only way to fit it all into the skull is to squeeze it together, like squishing up a piece of cloth to fit it into a tight space. This means that the cerebrum has lots of folds in it. The bits that go in are called sulci (a single sulci is called a sulcus) and the bits that go out are called gyri (a single gyri is called a gyrus) and they all have names. [Mammals that arent as intelligent as humans have smoother cerebrums, with fewer sulci and gyri, if any.]  The cerebrum has two halves, or hemispheres, which are approximate mirror images of each other. They are joined only by some tracts of white matter (like a bunch of USB cables instead of just one), so the two halves can work together. The main tract of white matter joining the two hemispheres is called the corpus callosum. It is in the middle of the cerebrum, next to the lateral ventricles. If you cut the corpus callosum, the left side and right side of the cerebrum cannot communicate properly. It is quite common for people with MS to have lesions on the corpus callosum. (A lesion is an area of damage or abnormality.)  The cerebrum is split into four lobes (areas): frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital. Because the cerebrum has two halves, there are right and left frontal lobes, right and left parietal lobes, etc. The frontal lobe is more or less the front half of the cerebrum. It stops at the central sulcus. The parietal and temporal lobes lie behind the frontal lobe with the parietal lobe at the top of the head and the temporal lobes at the sides, more or less behind your ears. The occipital lobe is right at the back. The frontal lobe is important for personality, working memory, decision making, controlling inhibition, movement, etc. The parietal lobe is important for sensation, maths, music, humour, spatial tasks, etc. The temporal lobe is important for hearing, memory, language, emotions, object recognition, etc. The occipital lobe is dedicated to vision.  The outer layers of the cerebrum are made up of gray matter. Together, these layers are called the cortex or cerebral cortex. Anything to do with the cortex is referred to as cortical. (Anything to do with the cerebrum is called cerebral and anything to do with the cerebellum is called cerebellar.) White matter lying close to the cortex is called subcortical (or superficial). White matter lying deeper into the brain is called deep white matter. There is also deep gray matter, found in the centre of the brain and the brain stem as well as white and gray matter in the spinal cord.  Amongst other things, the cerebellum is important for making all kinds of movement smooth, for balance and for learning new motor skills. The brain stem is important for many fundamental functions like sleeping, breathing and heart rate. Many of the cranial nerves come from the brain stem, controlling things like eye movements, sensation and movement of the face, mouth and tongue, and swallowing.  In general, the left side of the cerebrum controls the right side of the body and vice versa. This is not the case in the cerebellum where the right side controls the right side of the body and the left, the left. All the nerves from the cerebrum and the cerebellum go through the brain stem to get to the spinal cord. The cerebral nerves cross in the brain stem so that the right side of the spinal cord controls the right side of the body and the left, the left. This means that a problem with the right side of the body might come from a left hemisphere cerebral lesion, a right hemisphere cerebellar lesion, the left or right side of the brain stem (depending on whether it is above or below where the nerves cross) or a lesion on the right hand side of the spinal cord.  The McDonald criteria stipulate that, to be diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS, patients need to have at least two attacks and at least one lesion in at least two of four specified areas of the central nervous system: three in the brain and one in the spinal cord. (You can download the full paper for free: its Polman et al. Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria. ANN NEUROL 2011; 69:292-302.) The criteria for primary progressive MS are a gradual progression of symptoms (normally of at least a years duration) and two of the following: a positive lumbar puncture, at least two spinal cord lesions, at least one lesion in at least one of the three specified brain areas.   The three brain areas in the McDonald criteria are juxtacortical, periventricular and infratentorial. Juxtacortical means next to / into the cortex, i.e. a lesion that lies right at the border of the gray and white matter close to the outer edge of the cerebrum. Periventricular means next to the ventricles. Lesions next to the lateral ventricles are very common in MS. They often form at right angles to the ventricles which, when looked at side on, look a bit like fingers poking up over a wall. These are called Dawsons fingers and are a classic sign of MS. Infratentorial means the brain stem and cerebellum; the areas under the cerebrum.  There are some parts of the cortex that are named after what they do. The most obvious of these are the visual cortex, the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. The visual cortex is the cortex in the occipital lobe; the gray matter that makes sense of all the information that your eyes gather. The motor cortex is the last gyri of the frontal lobe, the precentral gyrus. It is in charge of movement. The somatosensory cortex is the first gyri of the parietal lobe, the postcentral gyrus. It is on the other side of the central sulcus to the motor cortex and it controls sensation in your body. If you put your hands loosely on both ears, your thumbs are pointing towards your visual cortex, your left and right ring fingers are pointing roughly towards your left and right motor cortices and your middle fingers are pointing roughly towards your somatosensory cortices.  Finally, a few terms that you might come across:    -  Anterior: in front; towards the front of the brain    -  Posterior: behind; towards the back of the brain   -  Superior: above; towards the top of the brain   - Inferior: below; towards the spinal cord   -  Horn/tip: refers to the ends of the lateral ventricles; the wing tips of the butterfly shape.

The early tingling I had may have been caused by Lyme, but its also possible that Lyme caused my MS symptoms or that it caused an immune response that gave me MS type symptoms. Or its possible that the two things are unrelated, though I find this less likely - what are the odds? All my doctors treat it as unrelated though, so I just have to go with that just now.  The next symptom I noticed was that the skin round my right side felt rubbery and numb when I touched it. Then I got muscle spasms round my rib cage which were very painful. I still get those. I like to say that at least it's a good work out. I have abs of steel!

92,Your first symptoms - looking back.., Thank you Space Monkey. I belive the tingling is a usual first presentation. Might be wrong. Hence why I am not sure I have MS. I get tingling but not for long and not often. I haven't gone numb anywhere apart from at night and I don't know if that counts? Cause I am thinking it is to do with my sleep. It's every second night and my arm/shoulder will go completely numb that its dangling and I am hitting it to try and get feeling back - oh does tingle when the feeling is disappearing and then as it appears again. Ive had this in my leg as well. But more often in my arm. But always at night. So I just don't know.  Awful you have Lyme as well. Ive read a little about that and believe it can totally drain you. That must be hard work dealing with both. I feel for you. It's great though - that you are working? I imagine it's a struggle but you should be proud of yourself for keeping that up. ,<p>Thank you Space Monkey. I belive the tingling is a usual first presentation. Might be wrong.

114,"Are we more susceptible to ""nervy"" things?"," Good question, which I dont have the exact answer.  However, as MS effects our nervous system I would guess that we could well be susceptible to other ""nervy"" conditions ?  I get terrible altered sensation on the palms and finger tips of my hands which is definitely linked to my MS as it gets worse when my mobility gets worse, my point is that mobility and touch are not fed by the same nerves, yet the MS has effected both parts of the nervous system that carry signals to these areas.  It's the same withbloating, many people with MS suffer from bloating, but you wouldn't think that MS could effect us in this way, but it can.

117,"Are we more susceptible to ""nervy"" things?"," Yes MS can affect digestive system and mental state. MS often slows the digestive process down, thus causing problems with bowels. Equally, it can affect brains, causing mental disorders. Obviously depression, memory trouble, cognitive problems (ie organising thoughts or dealing with complex information or competing information) ormild cognitive impairment for example.  I suspect MS can be a root cause, or contributory factor for a great many other conditions, or for different areas of the body.

140,Sensitive hearing," Hi Everyone.  I hope you're all okay. I need advice please. Hearing sensitivity isn't a new thing, where every sound is magnified and extra loud. This usually happens in both ears and only for a day or two. I've now had this for over two weeks. It's only in my left ear but all sounds are REALLY loud, distorted and accompanied by a whistling sensation. I can't tell you how distressing it is. The fridge, freezer, tumble drier, washing machine etc are driving me insane, and I can't cope with voices, the tv or radio. The ringing phone or dog barking can bring me close to tears.  I went to the GP yesterday and nearly fell off my chair when she hit the tuning fork. She checked my ears and can't see anything, so thinks it's probably neurological. Normally I put headphones on and listen to a book as I can set the volume low and just hear one voice which is calming. Obviously that's not going to work now. I'm wearing ear plugs in my left ear and can't leave the house but I can't do that long term..  Does anyone have any suggestions or have you experienced anything like this lasting so long?  I'm supposed to spend this weekend in a barn helping with a live nativity, so lots of people and animals in a huge echoing space. Can you imagine anything worse when your ears are sensitive?  Thanks  Cath x ","<p>Hi Everyone.</p><p>I hope you're all okay. I need advice please. Hearing sensitivity isn't a new thing, where every sound is magnified and extra loud.

153,How quickly does PPMS progress?," Hi All,  My partner was diagnosed with PPMS in January. I am still trying to get my head around it all. When I have googled how quickly it progresses, I have found out that it is generally a steady progression. I have also found something which states that it can take twenty years to progress to 8 on the EDS scale. Twenty years, for someone diagnosed in their late fifties feels hopeful although obviously it would be great to not have the diagnosis at all. However, both these findings feel contradictory.  It would really help to hear of people's experiences of progression, if at all possible.Any other information that you have found out would be greatly appreciated; the MS nurse has been beyond useless!

154,How quickly does PPMS progress?," Hi Anon  No two people have the same combination of symptoms or progressive rates. I've nursed people in wheelchairs in their 20s, and I've met a woman in her 70s who had just started using a stick because her vision kept blurring which made her trip a few times. What's also important to know that some symptoms come and go or get worse and ease up again. The word progressive doesn't mean you're on a steep slope down.  An old friend and I were talking about this a few weeks ago and we both reckon I've probably had it since my early 20s as I was really clumsy, I got really ill from some minor infections and was not very physically strong. I'm now 50, use a stick and live on my own with a helper who comes in once a week to help with jobs I've not been able to do or can't manage. I've also got other health issues which makes this remarkable.  The important thing is to just focus on your current issues and find ways to cope with them. The people on here can be surprising with their ingenious ways of overcoming problems and no symptom hasn't been discussed, you can ask anything anonymously if you're self conscious.

If anybody can help or advise me what can I do. I was diagnosed in March 2017 with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis. I know that my condition has deteriorated because I am fatigued more and unable to walk fewer distances. I got in touch with my neurologist who sent me for an MRI scan. I have now recieved a letter to say I am not eligible for the new treatment as my scan does not show new demyelinating lesions. This was the first treatment for PPMS and I had waited for so long for it. But I have been refused. 
Any advice would be much appreciated

163,What to expect," Hello NickE, and welcome to the forum.  I'm sorry to read what an awful time you're having with your MS. As you may already know, the condition is quite variable and everyone's experience is different. I'm afraid no one can predict what will happen next, but there are many on this forum who will have experienced similar symptoms to your own, so you are amongst friends and will be understood here.  As to which variant of the disease you have, I think it's probably a bit early for the consultant to be certain; I wasn't told for a very long time. The medics seem to need to monitor your progress for a while before deciding whether you are PPMS, RRMS or SPMS; I don't think it is apparent simply from the test results, but I could be wrong.  I'm intrigued to read that you were treated at an open MS clinic, I've never heard of one of those, but I live in a rural area and am guessing that was in a city.  You seem to be seeing all the right medics and getting tests and treatments, so just hold in there. It might be useful to keep a timeline of main events and any new symptoms (just a summary) to take with you when you next see your neurologist, so you don't forget anything important; memory alone can often let you down. Also make a note of any questions you want to ask.  Meanwhile, keep reading the websites of the MS Society and the MS Trust, they are by far the most reliable sources of information. And keep an eye on this forum, we all share experiences of symptoms, treatments and just living with MS.

171,PPMS Fasting mimicking regime," Is there anyone out there who he has had experiencewith a fasting mimicking regime?  I, first,got excited by this when I saw an articlein a newspaper https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/02/diabetes-drug-offers-hope-new-treatment-multiple-sclerosis   The underlyingresearch paper https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(19)30350-9 was followed by a number of newspapers.  On the face of it, it is about a drug,Metformin. You cannot get it from a doctor for MSbut that is ok because, if you read the paper,the drug merely is there to replace a fast.  Fasting is the key to 1. stopping theimmune system attacking thenervous systemand 2. replacingthethe myelin sheaths around the nerves in the brain.  It is true that I am not a rat but,since there is no treatment for PPMS, I thought that my research into fastingwas worthwhile.  Neurologists cannot suggest a fastbecause it is not backed up with research on humans but that is years away and I do not have years.  Anyway, I am no good at diets so I bought the Prolondiet suggested by Prof. Longo. https://youtu.be/dJVF4sCylsw . Incidentally, he does not benefit financially.  I don't like the word diet as it suggests that you are doing it to lose weight. I am not. It may have that effect but onlyon the side. I prefer ""regime"".  There are, as far as I can see,two things to understand--firstly it is not the fast which produces the result but the ""refeeding"" afterwards and,for that,you need to go onto a Mediterranean type eating regime.  Anyway, I am now onto my second monthly fastand I wanted to know if anybody else had had any experience ofthis.  I would say that I feel better generally but I still have brain fog and balance issues.  Apparently, it will take a few months to see real changes.

226,Forum FAQs,"    Important  I'm a new user, why are my postsare not published instantly?   Our staff moderators need to approve your first three posts before they appear on the forum. Moderators work 9.30am  5pm, Monday to Friday. If you post during an evening or weekend, well moderate your post first thing on the next working day.  Our sincere apologies that we cant instantly publish new users posts. Weve agonised long and hard about this. Without thesechecks, the amount ofspamposted on the forums makes them practically unusable.     How do I create a new post?   To create a new post, simply click on the category board which is relevant to your post. At the top of that page, you will see the New Thread button. Click this button, add your title and post. Please note, if you're a new user - your first three posts will need approval before they are published (see; I'm a new user, why are my postsare not published instantly?)     How do I get in touch with a moderator?   The forum is monitored by a number of moderators, this is to help ensure that the forum remains a friendly, secure and valuable space for all members. If you have a query, suggestion or need help using the forum, you can reach the team via:  communityteam@mssociety.org.uk  , alternatively you can also private message Oliver - Admin should you need help.     How do I edit my profile settings?   From 'My Homepage' you can edit your profile settings;change avatar, location details, whatyou're interested in etcby clicking 'My Profile'. Please ensure you save the changes for these to update.      What does this abbreviation mean?   For a list of abbreviationsused on the forum, please use this link &gt; https://community.mssociety.org.uk/forum/everyday-living/abbreviations-p...      Can I change the display settings?   Yes, If you click the ""accessibility"" link at the bottom of the page or go to http://www.mssociety.org.uk/accessibilityyou  can change the background colour to a high or low contrast option or a low graphics version of the site.     How do I receive email alerts for threads?   Get email alerts for individual posts by clicking ""subscribe"" at the bottom of the original post on each thread.     What is 'my favourites'?   Its a feature that allows you to save posts from the forum to your favourites list. Under the original post at the top of each thread theres an add to favourites link. Click this and the post will appear in the my favourites list on the right hand side of the page when youre in the forum (remember this block doesnt appear on individual posts  see above).  To delete a post from your favourites, click the X next to the title in the my favourites list.     Mobile Devices   The forum itself, although accessible on mobile devices (smart phones,iPadsand Android tablets) is a desktop site, meaning it has been built for use on a computer or laptop. Its not an app and unfortunately, its not entirely mobile compatible. Were aware that tablets and mobiles are increasingly peoples web browsing tool of choice and were working towards accommodating that.     Private messages and buddies   There are blocks on the right hand side of the page when youre logged in that link directly to your private messages and buddy lists. You can also access your private messages via my homepage. Please note if you havent yet added any buddies the my buddies block will not appear on the page.  These only show when youre on the forum homepage or the listing page for an individual board but not when youre looking at a forum post. This is because a lot of people asked for posts to cover the whole width of the screen so they didnt have to scroll so much when looking through them.     How do I protectmy identity from the real world and my online identity from other forum users   To hide your identity please choose a login id that is suitably anonymous (i.e. Not your real name, or email address) and be selective about the personal details you post to the system (see also: user control panel)  To hide your on-line name from other forum users when posting, check the box labelled  Post anon (Hide my username from other posters). This way you can post about something extra sensitive or personal without revealing anything else about yourself, even your username.  Please use the Post anon facility responsibly.     Tags   We have a system for tagging posts to allow you to categorise them by topic and also tofilterthe forum to see only posts on a particular topic or topics.  When youre writing a new post, remember to tick the most relevant box or boxes to what youre posting about. This will mean others will see your post when theyfilterthe forum to show posts about that topic.  Tagging your posts also means we can signpost people to the forum from the rest of thewebsite. We can pull titles of forum posts into related forum posts lists on relevant pages.  For example, we might set it up so the titles of posts tagged with emotional support appear a page about coping with diagnosis. Someone looking at that page would then immediately know that theres a community here that knows what theyre going through and can give them the help and support they need.     User control panel   Access everything to do with your account and your profile via  my homepage  (link in the top right corner of the page). My homepage has a link to my account where you can manage your username, password, email address and personal details and my profile where you can upload an avatar and also fill in and edit your profile.  Remember, the information you enter in my profile will be visible to other users as when theyre logged in whilst the information in my account is private.     How do I cancel my account?

232,Frustration with PIP," This post is just me reaching out for some friendly advice.  My Mum has had MS for over 20 years now and more recently things have started to deteriorate, most noticeably her memory. She loses things and forgets conversations we have had, even if they were half an hour ago. I understand this is all part of MS and some days are better than others. She has had PIP assessments before, but this time they called the house when I was out and my dad was upstairs. The assessment team questioned her about the forms and she was on the phone for nearly half an hour,  to which the person mum spoke to made a comment about her being able to talk on the phone for that long, she was in such a state when I got back, I tried to calm her but she was so upset that she couldnt remember any of the conversation she had apart from what the person said at the end. She said they were just quick firing questions at her. She got so stressed out by it she has been in bed now for the last 2 days, just too exhausted to get up and her back is really painful. 
This post is more about my frustration with the PIP process and how they can treat people with MS so unfairly. I just dont know how to make the process easier for her, Its hard enough seeing her in pain day after day but this as well. It's like they are trying to catch people with MS out, like they are faking it. No one would chose to have MS I'm sure, and it has to be diagnosed by a doctor through brain scans and assessments. I just dont understand how they can get away with this. Sorry, I'm writing this with tears of frustration and just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced anything similar.  Thank you.

Her confusion completey subsided as the infection did.  she came home, a week later, she started with the confusion again, and again, was admitted for a chest infection.

She came home, 2 weeks this time, the confusion started again, and again back in hospital with a chest infection. she is just about to be discharged from hospital again and we are worried she will be home a few weeks and this will happen again.   im wondering if anyone has had any experience similar?

It is taking a toll on our relationship and she simply hides away and does not talk to me esp on her bad days. She shuts herself away and does not want to see me or talk to me. I would do anything to truly understand MS and it affects her and I have done my research and what she has told me but again she thinks I dont understand it. Yes I know I will never truly understand but I want to!   She is still in denial and hates MS and wont accept help or counselling and deals with it her way. It's either that or no way at all.

240,New to this..," Hi  Not knowing either of you as individuals or as a couple any opinions or advice is likely to be bad and wrong or good and right. So I can only suggest the vaguest stuff. Having a complex tough health condition with uncertain outcomes is pretty tough to get your head around. You can not force her to see it from your perspective but I have found it useful on occasion to ask ""how would you react if the boot was on the other foot?"" (this can also be a useful question for ourselves) We process stuff for other people differently than for ourselves.

So I can only suggest the vaguest stuff. Having a complex tough health condition with uncertain outcomes is pretty tough to get your head around. You can not force her to see it from your perspective but I have found it useful on occasion to ask ""how would you react if the boot was on the other foot?"" (this can also be a useful question for ourselves) We process stuff for other people differently than for ourselves.</p><p>MS (or any health issue) is not a hobby or a club, it is a part of our lives but does not have to be the defining part.

241,New to this..," Hi  Thankyou for taking the time to reply. As individuals we are both I would say strong, independent and stubborn. I do admire her in every possible way how she manages and copes with MS on a daily basis. She has opened upto about her symptoms, the fatigue and generally does tell me, but I do feel I walk on egg shells at times because she does tend to shut down and deals with alone. I want her to know that I'm there for her but is it enough?? I have more or less begged her to talk to me and tell her it's so important to communicate but I get 'we are going around in circles' reply.  How do I respond to that when she won't tell me. What can I do or say to let her know I am there for her and I'm not going anywhere. She is my one true love and we have been through alot together already before Ms came along. Almost 20 years history and been together offcially 2.5 years. I'm sad that she feels she can't talk to me and I do understand that she is most likely coming to terms with it. I'm worried if I suggested we go for some help she would be offended as she trys to deal with it in her own way. I want her to know iwill support her to the best ability I can.

249,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI,"   MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging    When you have an MRI scanning session, they run a number of different scans. The standard ones, that are run for pretty much all medical conditions, are called T1 and T2. Scan types are constantly being developed, but the most commonly used additional scan type for MS investigations is FLAIR. You will also hear of PD, FSE, STIR, DWI and others, but Im not covering them here.  The way MRI works is that different types of matter give off different levels of energy when they are placed in a magnetic field. The computer slices the thing being scanned and collects the energy signal from one slice at a time. Because of some of the loud banging noises the scanner makes, it can also work out the signal from small cubes of each slice. These cubes are called voxels (short for volume pixels).  Each slice provides the information for one image and each voxel provides the information for one pixel in that image. The whole process uses some very advanced mathematics, but ultimately, the higher the overall signal from a voxel, the brighter the pixel is on the final image (and the lower the signal, the darker the pixel). This is where the terminology gray and white matter is less than helpful so bear with me!  In a T1 scan, gray matter gives off a low signal and looks darker in the images than white matter which gives off a higher signal and looks pale gray. CSF meanwhile gives off the lowest signal and looks black. Everything is reversed in a T2 scan: gray matter looks pale gray, white matter looks darker gray and CSF looks white. FLAIR is a clever adjustment of a T2 scan which suppresses the signal from CSF. This means that we end up with gray matter looking pale gray, white matter looking darker gray and CSF looking black.  Different lesions give off different signals too. In general, a white matter MS lesion gives off a high signal in T2 and FLAIR scans, leading to it looking like a white spot against the white matter which looks relatively dark in these scan types. T1 is usually rubbish for spotting MS lesions unless the lesion has caused the area to die, or atrophy, in which case it is called a black hole  because it is a wee black hole on a T1 image. The terms hyperintensity, hyperintense, high signal, etc, all refer to the fact that somewhere is brighter / whiter than it should be. Hypointensity, hypointense area, etc, refers to somewhere that is darker than it should be. Exactly what relevance these have depends on their size, shape, location and the type of scan though.  Remember that I mentioned CSF bathes the brain? That means that all the sulci of the brain are full of CSF and so there is a lot of white on T2 images. Spotting a lesion in amongst lots of perfectly normal white stuff can be tricky, however it is really quite easy in FLAIR images  because there shouldnt be very much white; all the CSF is black. (Please note that some small white spots can be perfectly normal  they are usually blood vessels.)  Sometimes, neuros ask for a scan with contrast. This is a T1 scan taken after the patient has been injected with a contrast agent. This is usually gadolinium which looks bright white on a T1 scan. The central nervous system, i.e. the brain and spinal cord, is protected by the blood brain barrier (bbb) which stops things that might harm it from getting in; gadolinium normally cant get through the bbb.  In MS, cells from the immune system get through the bbb and attack the myelin coating of nerves in that area, causing inflammation and damage: a lesion. While this is happening, the lesion is called active, enhancing or contrast enhancing. The gap the immune system has caused in the bbb allows gadolinium to get in. If there are no breaches in the bbb, there should be no bright white signs of gadolinium inside the brain or spinal cord. If there are, these show where there are breaches, in other words, where the immune system is actively causing new damage.  Contrast is used for two main reasons: to show up very new lesions (typically lesions newer than about six weeks) because these can be difficult to see on normal MRI and to help show which lesions are active and which are not as this can be important for deciding on meds. Newer types of scans, e.g. DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) which measures water flow, can be used to do this too so contrast is being used less often these days.  Some terms you might come across:    -  Sagittal: images taken from ear to ear, parallel to the nose     -   Axial: images taken from front to back, at right angles to the nose    -  Coronal: images taken from the front to back, parallel to the nose and so that one slice goes through both ears   -  Artefact/artifact: a computer error, nothing to worry about   -  1.5T (and other numbers followed by a T): This is scanner strength, i.e. how strong the magnetic field is that the scanner produces. The T is short for Tesla, but has nothing to do with the T in T1 and T2 scans.  Most NHS scanners are 1.5T. There are a few 3T (and stronger) scanners that are much more powerful than 1.5T scanners, but these are usually run by Universities. Do not assume that private MRI scanners (or scans) are better than NHS scanners (or scans)  they are mostly the same, but can be worse.  For those of you who arent quite brain dead yet(!)...  Partial volume effects are an important factor in how good a scan is and are particularly relevant if you are told your MRI is clear or you have no new lesions when you are having new symptoms. Remember that the computer slices up whatevers being scanned and then splits the slices into little cubes, the signal from these determining how dark or light a pixel will be in the image? Well, the size of those cubes has a major effect. Imagine a voxel that only contains white matter.  In a T2 scan, that voxel will give a low signal and the resultant pixel will look dark gray. Now imagine a voxel that is mostly white matter, but also has a bit of a lesion in it. In a T2 scan, lesions give high signals, so the pixel will now look brighter than the last one. But by how much? If its a small voxel and the lesion provides a decent proportion of the signal, the pixel will be obviously brighter than its neighbour and a radiologist should spot it easily.  However, if its a big voxel, the extra signal from the lesion might only make the pixel a wee bit paler than its neighbour and make it very easy to miss. So, the moral of the story: its important to have thin slices and small voxels! 3mm slices are fine. Less than that is great, more than that and you are losing a lot of definition and increasing the chances of missing small lesions.  By the time you get to 6mm and thicker, you could miss average and even bigger than average lesions too. (The average MS lesion is 7mm.) The slice thickness is not usually written in reports or on images, but the number of images is the same as the number of slices so the greater the number of images in one scan, the thinner the slices.  The best images generally come from thin slices with small voxels on a stronger scanner, but small voxels on a 1.5T scanner will be better than big voxels on a 3T scanner every time. ","<p><strong><u>MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging</u></strong></p><p>When you have an MRI scanning session, they run a number of different scans. The standard ones, that are run for pretty much all medical conditions, are called T1 and T2. Scan types are constantly being developed, but the most commonly used additional scan type for MS investigations is FLAIR. You will also hear of PD, FSE, STIR, DWI and others, but Im not covering them here.</p><p>The way MRI works is that different types of matter give off different levels of energy when they are placed in a magnetic field. The computer slices the thing being scanned and collects the energy signal from one slice at a time. Because of some of the loud banging noises the scanner makes, it can also work out the signal from small cubes of each slice. These cubes are called voxels (short for volume pixels).</p><p>Each slice provides the information for one image and each voxel provides the information for one pixel in that image. The whole process uses some very advanced mathematics, but ultimately, the higher the overall signal from a voxel, the brighter the pixel is on the final image (and the lower the signal, the darker the pixel). This is where the terminology gray and white matter is less than helpful so bear with me!</p><p>In a T1 scan, gray matter gives off a low signal and looks darker in the images than white matter which gives off a higher signal and looks pale gray. CSF meanwhile gives off the lowest signal and looks black. Everything is reversed in a T2 scan: gray matter looks pale gray, white matter looks darker gray and CSF looks white. FLAIR is a clever adjustment of a T2 scan which suppresses the signal from CSF. This means that we end up with gray matter looking pale gray, white matter looking darker gray and CSF looking black.</p><p>Different lesions give off different signals too. In general, a white matter MS lesion gives off a high signal in T2 and FLAIR scans, leading to it looking like a white spot against the white matter which looks relatively dark in these scan types. T1 is usually rubbish for spotting MS lesions unless the lesion has caused the area to die, or atrophy, in which case it is called a black hole  because it is a wee black hole on a T1 image. The terms hyperintensity, hyperintense, high signal, etc, all refer to the fact that somewhere is brighter / whiter than it should be. Hypointensity, hypointense area, etc, refers to somewhere that is darker than it should be. Exactly what relevance these have depends on their size, shape, location and the type of scan though.</p><p>Remember that I mentioned CSF bathes the brain? That means that all the sulci of the brain are full of CSF and so there is a lot of white on T2 images. Spotting a lesion in amongst lots of perfectly normal white stuff can be tricky, however it is really quite easy in FLAIR images  because there shouldnt be very much white; all the CSF is black. (Please note that some small white spots can be perfectly normal  they are usually blood vessels.)</p><p>Sometimes, neuros ask for a scan with contrast. This is a T1 scan taken after the patient has been injected with a contrast agent. This is usually gadolinium which looks bright white on a T1 scan. The central nervous system, i.e. the brain and spinal cord, is protected by the blood brain barrier (bbb) which stops things that might harm it from getting in; gadolinium normally cant get through the bbb.</p><p>In MS, cells from the immune system get through the bbb and attack the myelin coating of nerves in that area, causing inflammation and damage: a lesion. While this is happening, the lesion is called active, enhancing or contrast enhancing. The gap the immune system has caused in the bbb allows gadolinium to get in. If there are no breaches in the bbb, there should be no bright white signs of gadolinium inside the brain or spinal cord. If there are, these show where there are breaches, in other words, where the immune system is actively causing new damage.</p><p>Contrast is used for two main reasons: to show up very new lesions (typically lesions newer than about six weeks) because these can be difficult to see on normal MRI and to help show which lesions are active and which are not as this can be important for deciding on meds. Newer types of scans, e.g. DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) which measures water flow, can be used to do this too so contrast is being used less often these days.</p><p>Some terms you might come across:</p><p><span><strong>-</strong> Sagittal: images taken from ear to ear, parallel to the nose</span></p><p><strong><span>-</span></strong><span>Axial: images taken from front to back, at right angles to the nose</span></p><p><strong>-</strong> Coronal: images taken from the front to back, parallel to the nose and so that one slice goes through both ears</p><p><strong>-</strong> Artefact/artifact: a computer error, nothing to worry about</p><p><strong>- </strong>1.5T (and other numbers followed by a T): This is scanner strength, i.e. how strong the magnetic field is that the scanner produces. The T is short for Tesla, but has nothing to do with the T in T1 and T2 scans.</p><p>Most NHS scanners are 1.5T. There are a few 3T (and stronger) scanners that are much more powerful than 1.5T scanners, but these are usually run by Universities. Do not assume that private MRI scanners (or scans) are better than NHS scanners (or scans)  they are mostly the same, but can be worse.</p><p>For those of you who arent quite brain dead yet(!)...</p><p>Partial volume effects are an important factor in how good a scan is and are particularly relevant if you are told your MRI is clear or you have no new lesions when you are having new symptoms. Remember that the computer slices up whatevers being scanned and then splits the slices into little cubes, the signal from these determining how dark or light a pixel will be in the image? Well, the size of those cubes has a major effect. Imagine a voxel that only contains white matter.</p><p>In a T2 scan, that voxel will give a low signal and the resultant pixel will look dark gray. Now imagine a voxel that is mostly white matter, but also has a bit of a lesion in it. In a T2 scan, lesions give high signals, so the pixel will now look brighter than the last one. But by how much? If its a small voxel and the lesion provides a decent proportion of the signal, the pixel will be obviously brighter than its neighbour and a radiologist should spot it easily.</p><p>However, if its a big voxel, the extra signal from the lesion might only make the pixel a wee bit paler than its neighbour and make it very easy to miss. So, the moral of the story: its important to have thin slices and small voxels! 3mm slices are fine. Less than that is great, more than that and you are losing a lot of definition and increasing the chances of missing small lesions.</p><p>By the time you get to 6mm and thicker, you could miss average and even bigger than average lesions too. (The average MS lesion is 7mm.) The slice thickness is not usually written in reports or on images, but the number of images is the same as the number of slices so the greater the number of images in one scan, the thinner the slices.</p><p>The best images generally come from thin slices with small voxels on a stronger scanner, but small voxels on a 1.5T scanner will be better than big voxels on a 3T scanner every time.</p>",23 Aug  2011 at 10:47 am,#5,104598,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/comment/104598#comment-104598,,,,,,,

Have had letter back from DVLA early October saying they had response from my consultant and...  Have been waiting ever since. Have phoned a few times, and told every time it's with the medical team and they can't give me any timescale for when they will respond. I can't drive while I'm waiting as most likely need to be assessed for getting special controls to drive. Am desperate to get back to driving and not have to rely on other people do much.  Great if you can share you're experiences and particularly how long it took. Also, any idea how long to get an assessment for using special controls? And to the original poster, do hope you've got your license now and how long did it take?

Very distressing, but have had nothing since.  Well, the steroids are over. Very strange experience! The 8(!!!!!) pounds i put on have now gone. Been through a couple of very bad days, extreme tiredness, very difficult to walk, etc. Although everything seems a lot better, still weak arms and legs and fatigue is hard to cope with. The MS nurse said to take time off work to recover, but I don't get sick pay, so had to get in! I think the steroids have done their job pretty well as I am recovering a lot quicker than I did in the summer.

276,"Are we more susceptible to ""nervy"" things?"," A few years ago I was declared to be SPMS after years of being RR.

286,What's the oldest person you know with ms?," Well, I never met her, but my great aunt lived to - we think - 87, with MS. From what I've been told, she was not wheelchair-bound until quite near the end - the last few months, perhaps. I'm sure quite a few people will need some kind of aid at 87, MS or not, so I don't think she fared a lot worse than most.  I know that she was very overweight and didn't go out much, and faced some criticism from other members of the family about that. But oddly, they don't seem to have taken into account that she was ill! I think it was a different era, and health problems were not openly discussed. I don't mean they didn't know she was ill, but I don't think it was ever mentioned.  I've no idea how much her health contributed to her obesity, or to her limited socialising. Several of her sisters were very big, so she might have been prone to that anyway.  The attitude of the family does seem to have been rather oddly unsympathetic. But I suppose they'd all lived through two world wars, and seen a lot of grief and hardship, so chronic illness wasn't viewed as particularly tragic. My Nanna didn't really recognise illness or infirmity, in herself or others, and one of her favourite mottos was: ""Can't is won't!"" In other words, she didn't really accept that anyone was ever too ill to do anything, but just accused them of not trying hard enough.

I'm sure quite a few people will need some kind of aid at 87, MS or not, so I don't think she fared a lot worse than most.</p><p>I know that she was very overweight and didn't go out much, and faced some criticism from other members of the family about that. But oddly, they don't seem to have taken into account that she was ill! I think it was a different era, and health problems were not openly discussed. I don't mean they didn't know she was ill, but I don't think it was ever mentioned.</p><p>I've no idea how much her health contributed to her obesity, or to her limited socialising. Several of her sisters were very big, so she might have been prone to that anyway.</p><p>The attitude of the family does seem to have been rather oddly unsympathetic. But I suppose they'd all lived through two world wars, and seen a lot of grief and hardship, so chronic illness wasn't viewed as particularly tragic. My Nanna didn't really recognise illness or infirmity, in herself or others, and one of her favourite mottos was: ""Can't is won't!"" In other words, she didn't really accept that anyone was ever too ill to do anything, but just accused them of not trying hard enough.</p><p>Tina</p><p>x</p>",16 Jan  2013 at 5:42 pm,#3,183878,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/comment/183878#comment-183878,anitra,,,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/users/anitra,,,

288,"Recent PPMS diagnosis, help!"," Hi and welcome to the Forum!  Yep, I'm still learning too - I was diagnosed with PPMS at the end of June this year.  There is only one drug at the moment for those of us with PPMS called Ocrevus - you may want to talk to your neuro about it in January as it's not suitable for everyone and there are risks involved.  Other than that, it's good that you are still able to exercise, and a healthy well-balanced diet is always a good thing.    MS seems to affect everyone differently and, as Karen has said, your MS Nurse (if you have one) should be of great help - mine's brilliant.  It can be one helluva shock when you first receive your diagnosis, so my advice would be to just take one day at a time and don't try to forecast the future.  The folks on this forum are very friendly and knowledgeable, so come on here and ask away at any time. We're all here for each other. xx ","<p>Hi and welcome to the Forum!

292,Any one receiving Income Protection?," I am having alot if trouble with Aviva Insurance and their Income Protection they offer. Wondering if any one else has had a similar experience?  I actually work for a Private Medical Insurer and have worked here for 12 years.  When I joined i didn't have MS and had income protection with the Friends Life- now bought out by AVIVA.  A few years after my diagnoses for Relapsing Remitting MS i had to reduce my full time hours to 16 hours. My income protection kicked in and my wage was 'topped up' by the income protection.  A few years ago I had my first child and my symptoms got worse and i wasn't fit to work at all. After a few months of this AVIVA sent Private investigators to film me and told me I was fit enough to go back to work full time.    After a long appeal process we came to an agreement that i would try going back to my 16 hours but will be based at home not in an office. This has been going really well for me and I've managed to stay in work and do I job I enjoy. But now Aviva have said they have done a further medical review and will not pay me anymore Income Protection payments as they think I'm fit enough to work full time.  I have been to Occupational therapists through work and they disagree that i can work fulltime, my manager feels I cannot work full time, My MS nurse feels this way and so do I but they have still stopped the claim!!

324,How quickly does PPMS progress?," My husband was dx with ppms in 2000 after having weakness in his right leg for a few years. He was 45. I think his progression was fairly typical: started using a cane in 2003, then two canes by 2006. By 2008 he was using a scooter for outside trips and had to give up driving. By 2010 he could no longer walk and graduated to a wc. We also installed a stairlift in our two storey home. He was able to get on and off the wc with assistance for a couple of years, but beginning in y 2013 could no longer do so and we purchased Hoyer Lift. By this time his speech and upper body were affected, including his hands, and he could no longer feed himself. We sold our home in 2015 and moved into a condo with a live-in aide as I could no longer take care of him alone. He declined rapidly after that and was having great difficulty speaking and swallowing. He was more or less bed bound. There were also cognitive challenges. In early 2018 he was taken to the hospital for vomiting and we were told he had aspirated bowel contents. Sepsis and respiratory failure took him four days later.  This disease destroyed my beautiful, athletic husband and our dreams of a happy future in retirement. My prayer go out to those of you suffering, including family members and spouses.

344,going on a cruise," Hello Louise  Ive only been on a couple of cruises so far (2 weeks till number three) so am by no means an expert. But I suspect that its only once youve been on a cruise that you find out what you need to know. By which I mean that you discover what you dont know.  For example, if a port is only accessible by tender, that means you cant leave the ship if youre a wheelchair user. And most of this information will be available on the cruise companys itinerary. You can also find out about the various ports, whats nearby, whether the centre of the town is walkable / wheelable- see the website https://www.whatsinport.com/   Also, you need to check exactly what is meant by the various destinations, eg, when a cruise has Rome in its itinerary, it doesnt mean it docks handily down the road from the city. Rome isnt on the coast, so ships dock at Cittavechia, about half an hour on a train from Rome.  Whats in Port also has maps of the port, and how to get to the main tourist destinations.  Then there are any number of Facebook groups and pages relevant to disabled travel. Equally, there are webpages galore, including a load of YouTube videos posted by disabled cruisers.  Maude is absolutely right when she says that people with MS arent any different to people with other disabilities. This is why adapted cabins are quite basically adapted, specific equipment has to be hired depending on the individual needs. When you consider people with MS are really not alike, our needs are very different from one another.  Hopefully you and your partner will enjoy many more cruises together.

I'm quite sure they won't give your son more or less points for the offer or otherwise.  If your son doesn't mind, you should stay in the room to ensure that the assessment is fair and impartial. When your son gets the decision (or before, he can request a copyof the assessors report which will be sent to the DWP), you'll/he'll need to check that what goes into the report represents what actually happened.  As for where the assessment takes place, if your son spends most of his time upstairs, near the loo, then I would suggest that's where he meets the assessor and explains why.

His balance is horrendous and without his stick walks like he is vegy drunk,he has developed a tremor in his hands,  his speech is slurred and his feet and ankles are swollen amongst other things. After previous attacks the additional symptoms have only lasted a brief time and things have gone back to how they were before the attack....over a month on and no change, he has been to GP and had check up and blood tests and all ok. Is this anyobe else in a similar situation? How long do we leave it before we accept these symptoms are permanent? Who do we turn to for further adaptations to our home? Feeing frightened!

His balance is horrendous and without his stick walks like he is vegy drunk,he has developed a tremor in his hands,  his speech is slurred and his feet and ankles are swollen amongst other things. After previous attacks the additional symptoms have only lasted a brief time and things have gone back to how they were before the attack....over a month on and no change, he has been to GP and had check up and blood tests and all ok. Is this anyobe else in a similar situation? How long do we leave it before we accept these symptoms are permanent? Who do we turn to for further adaptations to our home? Feeing frightened!</p>",10 Aug  2019 at 10:13 pm,#1,86190,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/forums/caring-someone-ms/secondary-progressive,,,,,,,
360,Secondary progressive," Hello  When youve become used to a remission following relapse pattern, you expect the symptoms to improve after some time.The problem with progressive MS is that often the symptoms do not improve, or only partially.  Everyones MS is different so we can only talk about our own experience, but for me, a month with no remission would be perfectly normal. In fact 3 months without remission would be perfectly normal. Im now Progressive Relapsing, so can have relapses with some remission, but cant expect complete remission. In fact I often didnt have complete remission when I was RR.  So, I suppose what Im trying to say is no one knows whether your husband will recover from the current symptoms. Or whether any improvements will be complete or only partial. In a way, you and he need to be patient, but also see if he can get some physiotherapy help. If there is a community physio service where you are, you could tryto access this (maybe ask your MS nurse, GP or neurologists secretary). That might help him get over this attack/flare/relapse.  Best of luck  Sue ","<p>Hello</p><p>When youve become used to a remission following relapse pattern, you expect the symptoms to improve after some time.The problem with progressive MS is that often the symptoms do not improve, or only partially.</p><p>Everyones MS is different so we can only talk about our own experience, but for me, a month with no remission would be perfectly normal.

362,Secondary progressive," Im also very much like Sue.  Initial attack out of the blue 6 years ago, no warning signs, diagnosed as RR, no complete recovery, stayed pretty much like that for around 18 months, then gradually worsened without anymore obvious attacks, then it was confirmed that I had progressed slowly to SPMS.  I've pretty much been in my current position for around 18 months, mobility is not good, balance isn't too bad, but absolutely awful strength in my upper legs , which is the cause of my poor mobility, walking distance is shockingcompared to 18 months ago, in fact even 8 months ago.  The more I try to push myself the worse everything becomes to the point that I'm just tripping over, with hardly any foot lift at all.  My consultant, like Sue, has labelled my MS as SPMS with Relapses, even though I've not had a sudden dramatic change to my symptoms, they've just gradually worsened.

I tell her all the time that she has a daughter partner and granddaughter who needs her but she just can't see it. All she can see is that she's in the way and causing problems for everyone else. 
Is anyone in this situation and if so how can I help her stop feeling this way ?   Many thanks  ","<p>Hello, </p><p>Would love some advise please.<br>

Life is too short to worry about what might be or might not be, he has PPMS he needs to realise this is not the end of his life, but just the start of perhaps a new one with someone who will give him lots of love and comfort and you can make so many new memories together.

Im a CBT therapist and what I tell my patients is to practice some relaxation e.g. breathing techniques or progressive muscle reaction, both are really helpful especially the controlled breathing as this slows down your breathing and keeps you in a relaxed state. I guess if youre new to injections it can be daunting, using the auto injector pen is easier. Ive recently started treatment as well and have to inject three times a week.

It has been posted on this site several times. 
Ring up your GP surgery and ask for the phone number of your incontinent nurse. 
She will come to your home and first ask you to empty your bladder. 
Then put on mobile scanner on your tummy and tell you there is still half a litre or even more of urine in your bladder and that is your problems, because the bladder and bowels are so close together they put pressure on each other. 
Do not ignore it with stupid fixes because if you bladder is over full it can be sucked back into your kidneys and destroy them. 
You need to use disposable catheter which you throw away after each use, it is not a big deal used thousands of them and never pissed in my pants for years. Used over 2000 over the years, 8 a day. 
In the house I have long ones  when I go to the pub I have mini ones which are in a little packet which you can put in your jeans pocket. Ladies in your handbag. Very discrete no ones knows, you have a problem. 
If you want details send me a private message but do not ignore it will not go away , it is part of MS.

460,How quickly does PPMS progress?," Hi again,  Thanks again for all of your contributions and replies. I am very touched. If I am honest, one of my biggest fears is my partner needing care at some point in the future, that I am physically unable to provide. I have been a support worker and know what it is like to not be strong enough to lift someone etc.  However, maybe I am worrying unnecessarily? There used to be a system called Direct Payments, where the person with the disability could employ their carers directly and be in control. Does this exist any more?  Is there an affordable way for ordinary people to bypass expensive agencies and buy in their own care, that is good quality and doesn't break the bank? Many thanks, in advance, for any ideas.

461,How quickly does PPMS progress?," I've had progressive symptoms on the right side of my body since I was 18. I'm now 32 and still mobile. However, I had a big relapse a few weeks ago, after 14 years of only slow PPMS symptoms. I can't find anyone else in a similar situation. The point is, the disease can be truly unique to everyone. This makes it unpredictable, and it's clear it doesn't always stick to the rules.   In terms of symptoms, I have a lack of sensation in the right of my body and mild weakness. My right foot lands pointing outwards. Apart from that, my disease is 'invisible' to others, but the numbness is frustrating and I have bladder/bowel/sexual issues. In the past I've had symptoms at a standstill for years, but recently I'm noticing the progression.   So, that's my experience. I recommend your partner takes a good multivitamin, as well as Vitamin D3 and B12. One of the best things is diet and exercise. I do stretches and some basic weight training and it has done wonders for me. Feel free to msg me if you'd like specifics.

465,Ocrelizumab," I started Ocrelizumab in January and so I have had 2 rounds of treatment so far! I have had scans that have come up all clear since my second infusion. Trust me I was anxious about those possibilities as well, but I think our mind does overexaggerate as these are rare occurrences, my doctor told me that they weren't plositiveit actually caused cancer yet as there have not been enough trials but they have to disclose anything that could happen to us. PML is very rare and they will take bloods and scans every year to monitor the situation so if anything does happen they will know straight away and be able to help us.  I would really try not to worry, I know it is hard but these are rare things that happen and it is best to try and relax so that your body is not tense and can let the medication have the best affect.  I hope this has helped you in any way - I would also reccommend drinking a lot of water in the morning before the infusion and eating something if you're up to it (it opens up your veins more so it's easier for them to inject - im sure you know :))  good luck x ","<p>I started Ocrelizumab in January and so I have had 2 rounds of treatment so far!

469,going on a cruise," hi thanks for you helpful feedback. we had problems when the ship docked as the walk to the port from the cruise ship was too far and in the hot sun, they didn't really advise how far the walks would be to the bus stops/taxi's etc. The tender was ok in fact but the walking became very difficult.  we set off but on one day managed to get on the tour bus but my partner could not make it back to the ship when the bus dropped usf on our return at the port, he was tired, the sun was up, he doesn't use a wheelchair at home so we did not think to bring one for the holiday so he was stuck on the port about 8 mins walk to the boat. In the end I walked to the taxi rank and asked a taxi driver to drive us the 8 mins walk. He did and charged us 25 euros for the pleasure!  . After arriving home we have decided that a small scooter would have made a world of difference. Lessons learnt I guess on that front!  My partner found it very difficult to find his way around the boat, he could not remember his cabin number or really where anything was on the boat, we could not be separated as he could not find his way to anywhere. I wondered if the cruise company could send out a map of the boat before departure or have one he could carry with him? I also wondered about colour coded decks if that would help? I realised that my partner relies on knowing his surroundings and when taken out of that environment everything became more challenging for him, and not a nice thing for him. Coupled with urgent needs for the loo, and not always knowing where they are on the boat! A map which highlighed the toilets or some electronic device which led you to them?  On one occasion when my partner became hot and very tired in the dining room, he could not walk the length of the ship back to our cabin I agreed to ask to borrow a wheelchair, the cruise staff were not willing initially saying the wheelchairs were only for an emergency and if he needed one we should have brought one... although finally they brought one, only to find my partner had wandered off, and I had to spend a further 45 anxious minutes looking for him.  I agree disability per se needs to be accommodated but there is something about the lack of predictability of the impact of MS which I suspect cannot be addressed anyway whilst recognising there were things we could have done better in our preparation for the holiday  thanks for listening.

470,going on a cruise," Hi Louise  It definitely sounds like youve had a massive learning experience from this cruise. It all sounds like it was immensely tiring for you both.  Because I'm a wheelchair user, we had completely different problems with our first cruise. All of the walking round the boat was fine for us, as my husband is keen to wander about anyway. The number of lifts weve been in is quite staggering. People are generally quite amiable and prepared to make space for wheelchairs, so thats no bad thing.  So its worth taking a wheelchair on board with you, even if youre not planning to use it all the time.  Once you become familiar with one ship, it makes sense to book another cruise on the same ship - that way you become familiar with where things are on that ship. There are often maps of each deck of each ship on the cruise companies website - you could always print some of these out so you have maps with you. But I agree the company should have maps available. Maybe they actually do? Youd need to ask at the ships information desk. That would help immensely.  The biggest problem with using a wheelchair or scooter would be that many of the excursions are not wheelchair accessible. So it costs a lot more to have private transfers to the various sights you want to see. Or you could just negotiate with a taxi driver to take you on a tour - much less expensive than going on a planned excursion, and less tiring too as it wouldnt be such a long trip and not as hot.  Do have a look at the Whats in Port website, that would give you a better idea of how far you might have to walk to get out of the port and onto a coach, or just the walk to the town.  I should think you became aware on this cruise of what equipment and helpyou needed. So a future cruise would be much less stressful, and more enjoyable for you both.

MS is so difficult to predict, I am hoping that your husband has managed to regain some of his health.

481,Secondary progressive," My better half moved into SPMS about 4 years ago and has gradually got worse over that time. The last 12-18 months she's fallen off a cliff edge to some extent. 4 years ago she could walk, albeit with a stick and we used a wheelchair or mobility scooter when out shopping. She could look after herself, cook, bake, make me a cuppa etc. Within 18 months she's completely immobile, confined to a wheelchair, no movement in her left arm/hand, can't dress or wash, has a SPC, can't even turn herself in bed (she has a hospital bed too). She's in constant pain with spasms.  So hard to predict where this illness will go. You read so much online about MS progression but very little really mentions those few sufferers who get to the advanced stage - most just says sufferers can live a full and long life like non-MS sufferers. It's almost like those who progress to EDSS 8 and above (my wife is between 8 and 8.5 now) are left out of discussions.  Sorry, rant over!  Hope your husband is feeling a bit better now and recovereda little. ","<p>My better half moved into SPMS about 4 years ago and has gradually got worse over that time.

His disease has progressed and now he barely has any balance while walking and is unable to jump in place or run. I have been in an immense amount of heartache and have become sort of desensitized by his up and down behavior. He is very aggressive one day and the next he expects our family to go on with our lives as if nothing ever occurred the night before. It is becoming very hard for me to deal with hence the fact that I am trying to understand that this is not his true character nor does he mean any malice. The way he reacts to things is violent sometimes and almost scary. Early this year we ran into a situation where I felt the need to get him help. He did well in the three days of staying in the facility.. But the disease is gruesome and almost harder on the family than the actual person battling it. I don't know who to talk to or what to say. For years I have been trying to paint the prettiest picture but it turns out that my heart is at the edge of the unknowing if i should take anything personal. I have become so used to the mistreatment and heartache. I wish that I could take it all away.  I love him so much but this is so hard.

561,Your first symptoms - looking back..," Hmmmm. The first thing that made me go to GP was that my speech was very slurred. I had woken a few days earlier with a lisp which I thought was strange but I honestly thought I had just bitten my tongue in the night. However when I discovered that I couldn't write properly either I was a bit worried. Within 2 days my speech was noticeably slurred and my writing was reduced to spider scrawl and I knew something wasn't right. My GP has always made me feel that I am wasting his time but on that occasion he said he didn't know what had caused this but that I needed an urgent brain scan. Needless to say, I was scared witless as I had thought I was a fairly healthy person until that point!  The only thing that may have caused alarm, now that I know it is MS, was that for a few weeks prior to this I had been waking with a numb hand but I had put that down to sleeping in a funny position. I had had a stiff neck once or twice so I had put that down to sleeping badly too. The only other thing was that I had had a dizzy spell lasting about half an hour about 3 days before the lisp appeared. I did thing I might have to take the day off work because I was having such trouble that morning but it cleared up as suddenly as it had started so I put it down to 'coming down with a virus possibly' and carried on with life.  Even when I found myself in hospital waiting for the MRI, I could've helped the doctors more if I knew what they suspected but they wouldn't tell me anything. As I was fit and well physically, I went for a little wander around the corridors when I was bored. I had no visitors as the hospital was closed due to the norovirus and phone calls were a little tricky due to the awful slurred speech so I often went walkabout. I found myself bouncing off the walls a lot though and just thought that I was more clumsy than usual. If they had asked about my balance and co-ordination, I could've given them another clue because of course, it's something that still happens a lot on a bad day and now I know it's part of the MS.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing, isn't it?  Tracey x ","<p>Hmmmm. The first thing that made me go to GP was that my speech was very slurred.

572,What's the oldest person you know with ms?," All you youngsters make me chuckle (says he from the ripe old age of 75) knowing that there are people not too far away from me who are older and have had MS for much longer.  OK, so I have only had the bl**dy condition for five and a half years, so that does not really answer the OP's question. The key thing to think about is that what happens to you will be whatever happens. It might be slow, and it might be fast, and if you are still young, then there is a chance that some of the wonder cures and treatments that are still in research may be available in time to help you. They are probably going to be too late for me. (Tough, so I have to deal with it.)  If you can accept that, then what follows is simple - do what you can while you still can do it. If things get worse, you will wish that you had done it (whatever that is) when you could, and you cannot turn the clock back. With something like MS, averages do not mean very much. The ""average"" life of a heart bypass is seven years - I had mine 12 years ago. MS knocks about five years off your life expectancy - and I am several years older than the ""average"" for men.  If you want a good quality of life, it all depends on what you mean by a good quality of life; do you mean scuba diving in the Caribbean, or popping down to the local for a decent glass of real ale?  Most of it is in your head, anyway - just go and do it as long as you can.

In a few weeks my face was more or less back to normal but the fatigue was immense. Also my hearing was not good in my right ear. Next port of call was ENT. The specialist concluded bells palsy wouldn't affect my hearing so an mri took place. That revealed t2 lesions. Hello neurology!  And here I am, 2 years down the road. During this time I hadan L.P. which revealed CIS. By this time I was experiencing a burning/tingling sensation in my hands when using a hair dryer, alsoIntermittent bouts of fatigue. Then a couple of months ago I had a strange weakness in my left forearm. It's still there.  I've had a 3rd mri now, it has showed some older lesions have slightly improved but there are a couple of new ones. Next Tuesday I see my neurologist. So far I am not on medication but I think that will be discussed next week. I'm feeling optimistic, I don't know if I am foolish to feel optimistic or not!  I think back and try and make sense of strange occurrences over the years. For example, I occasionally get a piece of food stuck in my osophaegus, I've had this happen for years. It gets stuck then goes into spasm. I can usually dislodge it with warm water and forcing myself to vomit, this is not ideal when it happens when enjoying a meal out!

591,Your first symptoms - looking back..," Hi Rachellong96  My symptoms started 10 years ago with a 50/50 split body. RHS felt normal, LHS felt numb and slow. Had an MRI which was inconclusive then. I am on Gabapentin which was 900 mg daily but after an episode of ""worms"" under skin on my tummy (horrible!)my GP said to increase until symptoms go. Now on 2100 mg daily. Top dose possible I think is 3600 mg  Generally okay on this, but other symptoms come and go. Get the MS hug which is painful, normally just on RHS ribcage  Still not diagnosed, but due to see neurologist again in November.

A visiting dog has left me thousands of little visitors that have bitten me for three nights. How horrid, no sleep, torture, I have spent 35 hours near enough spraying, boiling, scrubbing, hoovering and then repeating the process. Just when I think I am winning, something starts biting. I am on my third boil wash, every sheet, blanket (cushions are in the bin), had to erect anextra washing line. I am rubbing a bicarb solution on my skin and head before I go to bed in the hope that it will keep them away or they are all dead. Strangely, it must be the horror of it all, I look quite well but when this has finished, I know that the fog will set in for days to make up for all this nastiness.  What is the flea for someone can please answer me that? I haven't even got any blasted pets. I was so desperate last night that I sprayed body spray all over my head to try to keep them away. I think it worked but then I found that I couldn't flippin breath so had to go out in the garden, oh my word!

616,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI," This is great Karen. When it says high spots or elisions in two or more areas of the brain for MS diagnosis is this peri ventricular plus one of the other two or can it be two areas of peri ventricular? My MRI report says 'one or two small high signal abnormalities seen in the peri ventricular white matter tracts this is particularly the case anterior lot on the left. Sagital imaging suggests these are perpendicular to the corpus callosum raising pissibility of demylenation. No florid signal changes elsewhere, no lesions on brain stem, cerebellar lesions, cervical spine unremarkable except disc bulge with stenosis at C5/6.'  I am not sure how there can be 1 or 2 high signals and then 'mainly' anteriorly on left. If there are only 1 or 2 they are either there or in that area and another or there must be more than 2 - sorry picking apart English   By the way is migraine visible on MRI I had a headache that day on left hand side which got worse in the machine.

Sagital imaging suggests these are perpendicular to the corpus callosum raising possibility of demylenation. No florid signal changes elsewhere, no lesions on brain stem, cerebellar lesions, cervical spine unremarkable except disc bulge with stenosis at C5/6.'

I'd looked a few things up on here but hadn't signed up until now.  I was diagnosed relapsing/remitting around 2 years ago. First sign to me was a sudden shock to my lower leg out walking the dog that left me with thigh numbness. Ignored it for a couple of months then finally went to see my then GP. I'd dislocated my kneecap several years back on the same leg so assumed I'd trapped a nerve or something.  Looking back now, my GP had her suspicions as my medical records had labyrinthitis a few years ago, a hand tremor a few years before that which I didn't even recall and a couple of other oddities that hadn't lasted long. Referral to a neurologist resulted in an MRI scan for head neck and spine, and me still assuming trapped nerve. Neuro gave me the preliminary MS diagnosis then a 6th month wait for another MRI to confirm it. Thankfully avoided the spinal.  Since then I've been on weekly Avonex injections with a couple of minor flares. Trickiest bit was telling work and family as until then most considered me pretty invulnerable as I never got sick.

646,Your first symptoms - looking back..," Hi everyone,  Im not diagnosed with MS but will go for my second brain MRI in January. The last scan was four years ago and showed non diagnostic subcorticalchanges. I was relieved as the neurologist said to wait and see and so I dismissed it. Shortly after that I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had four surgeries no radiation or chemotherapy and assumed all my symptoms were attributed to the cancer. My last surgery involved discovering in therecovery room from the doctorthat I had sleep apnea. My GP was surprised due to being 50 and not overweight. So all's manageable until recently when I'm so exhaustedagain worse thanbefore I got the sleep apnea machine. My arms start swelling slightly they diagnose mild lymphedema but as it should only be in the arm on the side which had sentinel nodes removed they CT scan brain head neck and MRI of chest for tumors. All results clear but this June sucked!!  So here are my symptoms mainly over the past four years:  1.Constant mainly-change in bowel health, inability to empty my bladder fully, urinary incontinence mainly when I had a cold, mixing up my words, not feeling like I could hold a good conversation as I'd lose vocabulary, fatigue, tense neck, choke on food if talk or think about responding to a question  2.Progressively worsening- left foot cramps(now right foot also and can threaten more often), crawling scalp,itching, dropping things as can't seem to gauge grasp/ pinch needed to hang on as I walk,some shots of pain or stinging in my legs and arms ( like insect bites) can wake me, fatigue worse.  3. Occasional- tired holding my arms to fold laundry or tired hips to waltz with my husband, tired jaw to chew, dizziness,off balance, go to step one way and lunge another, tired of talking/ thinking  4. Happened once- sensation of water dripping down back of leg with horrible back and legpain that went away too fast to be discogenic, tried to order lunch from waiter I'd just recently placed an order with( scary)  5. Childhood symptoms ??-double vision clearing before surgery was required, electric shocks through whole body when jumped one summer( just thought I hadn't been bending my knees), numb patch on left thigh(saw neurologist but cleared after going to chiropractor).  Has anyone else had sleep apnea as a symptom of MS?  These symptoms led me usually sosuper healthy and strong to the GP who found the cancer thankfully at a really early stage. Now four years later I'm wondering if it wasn't MS that caused the wheels to start to fall off my wagon.  wow just saw this is very long... my first ever post on a blog...Thanks for sharing your symptoms.

657,Brain Fog," Thank you, the soothsayer spoke and sayeth nay, nay and thrice nay, the little beggars have had their commupance (excuse the spelling). A little bit of patience for a few days now just to be sure and a bit more boiling up things just to be sure and fingers crossed. A quick visit to Matalan whilst the bugs were being dealt with means that I have new bedding.  I said to 'Mick' the flea man, that in the middle of the night I was considering that if there is a spiritual force, why did they invent fleas? What use are they? Then Mick showed me his legs and back! He destroys pests of all kinds. He went on holiday last week to France bibawaking and a straw ferralcat brushed into his sleeping area twice. He thought he was being bitten by the midges but after his whole body turning red raw and him stripping off and running in cold water to try to ease the pain and soreness, he realised that the flea man himself had been riddled with fleas. Busman's holiday - fortunately he said wherever he goes, he takes a small blasting pack so blasted the area and waited up till the cat wandered in and blasted that too. I thought I was fed up, he looks like he should be taking his skin to hospital it was that bad. What next, yes let's hope there isn't famine. I've got a feeling that something is on its way, I have been really lucky for months, never lasts long does it?

664,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI,"  Thanks for posting all this information, its great and I understand the criteria. However I do not understand what ""enhanced"" means. Here is what it said:      There are multiple punctate areas of peripheral white matter hyperintenity.   there is a posterior focal area of periventricular high signal with two similar areas on the right that appear to be inferior callosal. There are several juxta cortical lesions particularly in the right frontal and right parietal regions.  there does not appear to be any associated cavitation.  these lesions do not appear to enhance.  no other abnormality is seen intracranially. The intracranial arterial vasculature remains normal in appearance.  Comment: The study was compared to that performed on 1/06/13. Periventricular/Pericallosal lesions.  : There is no evidence to suggest any involvement of the temporal or occipital regions nor the posterior fossa structures.  : There is no cavitation or enhancement  0verall, there appears to be some relative increase in size of at least 2 lesions within the frontal lobe and a possible periventricular pattern that also appears to have increased in prominence. Although not conclusive , these changes make the possiblity of underlying demyelination a little more likely. Does this corrolate with other clinical tests?

I have also been recently diagnosed as having Epilepsy due to having had two huge seizures over the last few weeks. I originally had a seizure back in December 2012, I then had an MRI scan to see if this showed any reason as to why I had had the seizure, which it didn't. However, it did show that I had had two minor strokes, this was reported as "" a couple of lesions to the left thalamus &amp; left lentiformnucleus which are probably small lacunar infarcts. I was then prescribed to take 75mgAspirin a day.I then went right uptoAugust of this year before I had another seizure, I then had to have another MRI scan. The day before I was due to have the scan I had another seizure. The MRI scan did not show any changes from the first scan that I had in 2013 so I was diagnosed with having Epilepsy, for which I am now taking Lamotrigine. However, I have recently received another letter from the neurologist to say thatthe areas that showed damage &amp; had been reported in 2013 as having been the two small strokes was now being reported as ""The previously identified T2 hyperintense foci in the left thalamus &amp; basal ganglia do not show any peripheral flare hyperintensity. These appearances are suggestive of perivascular spaces rather than lacunar infarcts.My question to you is would the neurologist have to ask for a specific type of MRI to be able to diagnose MS or would the neurologist be able to pick up onMS no matter what the scan was for?   I hope you can answer my question if not would you recommend that I go back to my GP with the information &amp; list of symptoms that I have &amp; insist on having further tests.

However, I have recently received another letter from the neurologist to say thatthe areas that showed damage &amp; had been reported in 2013 as having been the two small strokes was now being reported as ""The previously identified T2 hyperintense foci in the left thalamus &amp; basal ganglia do not show any peripheral flare hyperintensity. These appearances are suggestive of perivascular spaces rather than lacunar infarcts.My question to you is would the neurologist have to ask for a specific type of MRI to be able to diagnose MS or would the neurologist be able to pick up onMS no matter what the scan was for? </p><p>I hope you can answer my question if not would you recommend that I go back to my GP with the information &amp; list of symptoms that I have &amp; insist on having further tests.</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Bev</p>",05 Oct  2015 at 5:39 pm,#51,311560,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/comment/311560#comment-311560,bevbam,,,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/users/bevbam,,,

She says that she has this rare condition that the doctors dont know about. She has spent so much money using private doctors because she says nhs doctors are useless. She has been in and out of A&amp;E in the last year 31 times!! Her feet her swollen, this is because she is not mobilising well but she feels it is as a result of something else.

I am really finding it emotionally draining. I dont have anyone to talk to about it and havent even told my 2 closet friends that my mum has MS. I have a younger sister who is 24 but is busy with her own life despite living in the samr house as my mum. My mum is slowly losing her independence and is depending on me alot. She stopped driving a long time ago. She recently saw a social worker, but bot sure what they can do. She really needs a carer to help her with cleaning the house, food shopping etc. I am worried about her state of mind because she says things like she has given up the fight. I am trying to help the best i can but with 4 children its hard to juggle. She has an incontinent bowel but still doesnt believe its her MS.  I'm writing this post while being locked in the bathroom, its the only place where i can let out my emotions. I feel so alone and dont know how i can help her. I want my old mum back.

685,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," Hi 
This is my first time using a forum so please bear with me if I inadvertently do something wrong.  15 years ago my husband experienced some symptoms of MS - to cut a long story short he was told he had a virus in his central nervous system and the results of a MRI indicated that he didn't have MS ""yet"". My husband brushed it off but the ""yet"" always stuck in my mind.  He had a horrific accident that nearly killed him 7 years ago and then a very serious bone infection that could also have killed him nearly 3 years ago. He has a lot of limitations due to the injuries from the accident. Everything took so long to heal and he faces, at only 38, countless more surgeries.  Then last summer he started getting tingling in his hands, after tests for B12 deficiency and nerve conduction tests proved nothing he had an MRI 3 days before Christmas. He was called again for another one ""with contrast"" (dye) on 10th of January and on 15th January he was diagnosed with RRMS.  The first MRI 14+ years ago showed one lesion - he now has over a dozen in his brain and a large one on his neck.  At first we were both relieved as it explained a lot of things that we were noticing.  He has started capaxone (I'm sure I've spelt that wrong) injections. Fatigue is a major part of his symptoms at the minute. The tingling in his hands isn't just as bad, neither is the double vision.  What I am finding very hard to cope with however, is his mood swings. I suffer from fibromyalgia, arthritis and depression myself.  The change in his mood at times is like flicking a switch...sometimes he is himself and within a second he could be shouting his head off.  I feel I am walking on eggshells around him. At times nothing I say is right and although I know deep down he loves me, his words can be quite hurtful. He can loose his temper quite quickly with our children (16 and nearly 14) they know he doesn't mean it but it is upsetting for them too. He NEVER has lifted his hand or anything like that to me or the children.   Technically speaking I know this is a page for MS sufferers but I was just wondering if anybody had anything similar happening to them within a relationship. I have been incredibly long winded in this post but I wanted to give whoever reads this a full insight into my life in order that maybe, hopefully someone would have any idea of what I should do.  If you have read this far down this post - thank you for taking the time- I know it's very long  Xxx ","<p>Hi<br>

688,Caring During The Night..," Hi everyone,  I care for my father who has secondary progressive MS, my sister and I divide his care between us, she does the mornings/day time and I do the evenings and provide support over night too. It's worked well for about five years now since his health declined, but I recently found out I'm pregnant and obviously having a baby to worry about means it's going to be super difficult to provide my dad the support he needs during the night.  Needless to say, we've approached the council about putting in care for him, we've gone through the standard rigmarole (had to do the various assessments and what not for my partner's mother last year...total nightmare!) and the social workers are taking their sweet time about confirming/refusing anything, they have however started to quibble about night time care. They do provide it, as I know three people with MS who get ""night-sits"" but of course, it's a fight to get them and maintain them.  They want me to provide an outline of what I have to during any given night, I haven't had a problem doing that but looking at it down on paper it doesn't seem like much. And knowing how much information we had to provide and how much of an uphill battle it was to get care for my partner's mother, I feel like it's not enough. I'm sure I'm missing a number of issues that have occurred during his really bad nights (which he hasn't had in a while now, thankfully!) and little things that have just become a way of life now.  I really want to provide a clear picture and make sure the council know just how bad things can be some nights because I worry they won't provide the correct level of care for him, if m they agree to any at all. From past experience (under another council) I know they will argued the toss on every task that was mentioned for day time support, so I'm feeling like this is going to be a massive.   I'm just wondering if anyone either with MS or caring for someone with MS can give me an idea of their experiences with night time needs?    I feel like I'm missing so much but it's been a while since my father's had a really bad night, but I feel like the council need to know every potential issue that could arise to ensure he's actually going to get the level of support he needs/that I've provided for years.

690,travel tips?????,"  Hi, I am trying to plan a holiday with my husband who has MS and our teenage daughter. As you will all be aware, this is no mean feat, coz I can't just pick a place to go and book it.

691,travel tips?????," Hello, just wondered if you'd considered a cruise? There are some fabulous itinerary's these days, and you don't necessarily have to fly either, loads sail out from the UK now. Cruise ships are really easy to get around, plenty going on,especially on some of the bigger ships,even for a teenage daughter, and you wake up somewhere different every day! You can chose whether to do the shore excursions, or enjoy the relative space and peace of being on the ship whilst other have gone ashore. I've only done one cruise, but planning another next year hopefully, I wasn't sure it would be for me, but am converted! ","<p>Hello, just wondered if you'd considered a cruise?

693,Abuse in caring," I have been with my partner for 12 years and although he has cared for me in that time he wasn't my official carer. He became my carer just over a year ago. I can walk with the help of aids and I can do things for myself he just took over on my bad days. Although we argue like every couple things came to a head a few days ago when he Had a few drinks one night ( we don't normally drink) he came upstairs the morning after andjust walked into the bedroom and snapped. He went crazy throwing me about slapping me and kicking my bad leg. I managed to get downstairs when he threw me on the floor and put a knife to my neck saying he was going to slice my jugular open. I knees him where the sun doesn't shine and managed to get back upstairs, my 17 year old was at the top of the stairs and managed to help me get my partner out the house.  He has never been anything but perfect up to that day he has never hit me or abused me in any way and I don't understand why he did what he did that day, does caring for someone cause so much distress that people can actually snap with the pressure????

From what you've written, you have had a good relationship with your partner for a long time, and that you were both under stress at this point. As this appears to have been a one-off, and that he was under the influence (unusually) of alcohol, I am wondering if you are both getting the support you need. I don't know your circumstances, of course, but it seems that there could be some additional support that you could access, through NHS or Social Care sources. Can I suggest that you ring up the Helpline, and discuss your options? There are lots of good people there who could offer you help, information and support to relieve tensions. Take good care of yourself, and I hope you have managed to make up with your partner and talk through what happened. ","<p>Dear Mina I'm so sorry to learn about what happened recently.

698,Advice Please," Hello, I'm new to this so bear with me. I'll try and keep it brief. My partner started with the symtoms of MS in Sept 2012, totally out of the blue. She was officially diaganosed around Feb/Mar 2013. Since her first symtoms she has continued on a rapid decline. Throughout her diagnosis I have been waiting and hoping for her to her some sort of remission but it hasn't happened. She's had numerous courses of steroids, including very high doses intravencley. She's had a plasma exchange. She was on avonnex for about a year and she has recently started on Fingolimod. Nothing has stopped her decline. She lost the use of her legs in Sept/Oct 2013 and that hasn't improved. Other than hospital appointments she hasn't been out of the house since Sept 2013 as she can't sit up for long or go on car journey's due to a terrible pressure and pain in her head. She's displayingALL the symtoms of severe MS described on this on this site and has done for a while.  Initially she was diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS but we haven't seen a remission. The specialist says that she having attack after attack in rapid succession. It's awful to see how she's suffering and I want some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. She seems to have got worse since starting the fingolimod. She was only 36 years old when diagnosed and is only 38 now.  I hear a lot about people with MS who only have a few relapses or go long periods between and essentially lead a 'normal' life, this has not been the case with my partner.  Has anyone been through a similar situation and more importantly did it improve? ","<p>Hello, I'm new to this so bear with me. I'll try and keep it brief.

701,Advice Please," Hi Mitchell  Because youve added your worry about your son to an old thread, its sometimes difficult to get relevant responses.  (Hint - you can just start a New Thread making replies more appropriate.)  To some extent, your son has to independently find a way of co-existing with MS the best way for him. You can ask him whether theres anything you can do to help, but we all have to learn to live with it in our own way.Its really not good that he doesnt have a supportive MS nurse.  It ishelpful sometimes to rage and express anger at the way MS had intruded into our lives. We dont have to accept it, or be positive about it all the time. Im still pretty angry at the things its taken from me. But sinking into proper depression isnt useful at all. He could speak to his GP about depression, but I know thats not an easy thing to do. Its not as if theNHSare always good at referring people to counsellors, the doctor is more likely to suggestCBT(cognitive behavioural therapy)or antidepressants.  You could suggest he looks for helpand advice from this site (the About MS tab at the top), or the MS Trust, their leaflets are excellent.You could even suggest that he joins the forum. Obviously we can only help with our own experience rather than professional advice, but we are pretty good at supporting each other.  Many people dont like the idea of joining groups, I personally am not keen. But I have good friends and my peers on this site are brilliant at giving help, support and fellow feeling. We even make each other laugh. Certainly a way of avoiding depression.  I hope you are able to gently help your son to find some support from somewhere and that he manages to live without depression.

702,The move to residential care," I have a friend with Secondary Progressive MS and things are now getting to the stage where his wife is finding the care very difficult and it is starting to impact the whole family quite severely.  There is not much that can be done that isn't already being done to keep him at home, so it could be time to start thinking what next. I can't help but think that the time is coming where some residential care is needed, either respite or full-time. But its a very difficult move for anybody to make and poses so many questions around where, how, financing etc. He is in his 40's so is quite young so getting the right place where he will have peers of a similar age is important.  Any experience of anybody in a similar position who can help would be much appreciated.

707,Struggling with mum's MS progression.," My Father has PPMS and was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It has taken him a long time to come to terms with it as he was a high flying business man before, now he is on disability. Initially he went downhill very fast, fatigue, weakness, nerve and muscle pain, cognitive loss a little bit, drop foot, inability to walk much even with a stick, and then... no change in the last 4 years, he seems to have plateaued for the time being. PPMS isn't always steady and she may not have symptoms coming on as fast as she is now, or has done, it can plateau at times. On the bright side, with PPMS there are no relapses, she can plan things a bit better as the day to day is more predictable, but coming to terms with things is always going to be hard. My dad has learned to take life a lot slower than he did before, he now spends most of his day socialising and knows almost every person in the town. Volunteering at the local library has helped him a lot as he can pass on his knowledge to those that benefit from it a lot - helping to write cvs, fixing people's computers, teaching english skills etc. I know exactly what you mean about the guilt. It kills me that I can't do anything, and that no amount of money or work from me can make him better. I suffer from guilt all the time even now, even though he says he is happier now than he has been in a long time, I know that he is suffering and it is awful to see your parent go through that. You are doing your best and that really shows. It is difficult to deal with, and hard to find the right support too as people that do not see MS regularly and know it struggle to understand. My partner tries his best but he can't see how deeply it affects me seeing my dad struggle like that. You are supporting your mother but you need some emotional support too. Make sure you take care of yourself as well and keep doing the things that make you yourself, you can't fill someone else's cup if yours is empty to start with. Be kind to yourself and know that this isn't your fault, you are only human, and there is only so much you can do. Hopefully your mum will come to terms with this and find ways to deal with the symptoms, and ways to find hope.  Know that you are not alone, and what you are feeling is normal. If you are struggling with the feelings of guilt and anxiety, go speak to your doctors and they can find ways in which to support both you and your mother emotionally.

717,pip," hi all, what a farse this pip lark is  i filled the foms in early 2017 to go from a dla indifinate award to pip which is a nightmare in itself. i had a face to face ( origionally in a nearby town 10 -15 miles away but there was no way i could have made it there let alone coped when i was there, and there was an actual place in my home town where they could have done it ) After a letter from my gp to say i cant travel to the location and want nearer they cancelled the app and made another- for the same place, Doh!!  yet again i contacted them and said i cant do that and i requested my home townto which finally i got one in my area.  The face to face i felt went ok but the stuff the lovely atos woman put in her report was rubbish, she said at one point about how we got there then said that she is not from the area so doesnt really know it well- well unfortunately for her i looked her up on social media and she lives less than a mile away from myself and went to a local school, one of the lies she said.  so got the letter from pip- 6pts care and 4 mobility- so thought they are at least aknowledging i have problems  Mandatory reconsideration- no change still the same award.  Right i did the tribunal route which they accepted the appeal to go to the courts.  Probably like many others with this illness i suffer from Vertigo which affects me going onto different floors in a building- this was all stated in my notes. Anyway i got to the court and did the security checks and the the security guy said  ' right its up on the 2nd floor'  obvious my reply was on the lines of i cant go up there and explained why to them. one of them went upstairs and had a word with the clerk and explained, they looked in my notes and the judge, disability person, doctor and dwp guy came down very apologetic and opened up a room on the ground floor, which was good of them to be honest.  After being in there for over an hour and being asked loads of questions they sent me out of the room and said they would make the decision and call me back, strangely the dwp guy had to come out too. He started talking to me and said i should go to CAB whatever the outcome and put in for it again. eh??  Anyway he went off, no idea where and the clerk called me back in.The judge started explaining the award and to be honest i had had enough and couldnt really take in what she was saying. she then said i have been awarded however many points on care and mobility which took my total so to put me on std rate for each.  What a relief , they printed me out their decision and said would send to dwp/piptoo.  That was on the 25th May- their origional decision was back in april 2017 i think.  Phoned pip on the following monday and yes they had recieved the decision from the court and was on a pile so go through.  I still have had no word from pip/dwp what is happening over 2 weeks later.  Anyway to anyone going through this keep plodding on through it, hopefully it will be worth it in the end if they ever get round to reinstating the payments.

I am constantly being told it costs 400 per month ! I don't know if that has any implications in the future but I have not been asked to pay for it again as some people have told me a long time ago.

She's at home with my dad who God love him tries his best but it can appear he takes more interest in his hobby of photography than mum but I think it's his way of coping. Neither of them are good at talking about the situation. I gave up my office job which I'd had for 30 years 5 years ago to help out a bit more. But what can you do with a deaf, blind, disabled 82 year old. She has accepted this is where she is but all I want is to make her happy but how do I do that. She says she's happy just to know I'm there, I go round for 3 or 4 hours 4 times a week. I could go more but dad and I don't have a great relationship so sometimes it's awkward. Plus I come home in tears most times. My husband is a great help with mum, he'll do more than a son in law should have to like hold her up til I wipe her bottom, help my get her dressed etc but he's not so good at understanding my depression about the situation. I've had no joy from the doctors either, they don't seem to see why I find mum's situation upsetting. My husband tells me to get a hobby and make friends but I was seriously let down by my friends or so called friends 5 years ago and so I now have no one. My mum is my best friend but I can hardly tell her that I cry 50 times a day over her situation and can't remember the last time I had a descent night's sleep. I just want to make mum happy.

740,Struggling with mum's MS progression.," Hello LucyAnnie  It sounds like you are being let down by so many people, your GP, your friends, your father, even your husband, however great, doesnt understand how depressed you are, or why.  You really are doing all you possibly can for your mother. If she knew that her disability was making you so unhappy and depressed, shed be horrified. It sounds like your husband is pretty wonderful to be able to help you with caring for your mum. Even your dad, however poor your relationship, does his best with and for your mother. Itreally is for the best that he does have a hobby, something that occupies his mind and time. If hed given up everything just to stay at hope for your mum, hed be as depressed as you, if not more so.  Perhaps you really do need to make your GP understand how bad you feel about your mothers situation. If you were to sit down and write how you feel, what it is about your mother that makes you feel so terribly low, it might help youexplainit to the doctor. It seems to me that you do need help to deal with your emotional state. Crying so much isnt healthy.  I understand that its through love that you feel so depressed, but love for you would make everyone around you feel better if you had some help, perhaps counselling, perhaps some medicinal assistance? Just understanding would probably help.  I wish you all the best, hopefully youll get some of that understanding and some help with your low mood. Possibly if you could climb out of the trough of depression you could find some time to do something for yourself. Maybe join a gym or exercise class, find a walking group or a book club, depending on where your interests lie. And if you were happier in yourself, your husband would be happier, even your mum might feel better knowing you are happier and healthier.  Best of luck to you and all your family.

741,Struggling with mum's MS progression.," Thank you for your understanding Sue, I really do appreciate the support I get from messages on here, the place where people understand what both mum and I are going through.

742,Struggling with mum's MS progression.," I dont believe you should just accept that this is your life for possibly years to come. You and your husband also deserve some good times. Youve worked all your life looking forward to a comfortable retirement, there is no reason why you should put all of your plans on hold. Im sure that as a caring and loving person youve inherited these traits from your mother. This means that wereshe to know you are exhausting yourself and hurting so much over the care of her, she would be horrified and tell you to start giving some time to yourself and your husband.  Why not think about some ways that you could take time away from your mother and still be confident that she was being well cared for. You could plan days out with your husband even if trips away from home are impossible. Or perhaps a weekend away (or a few days in the week!) would do wonders to recharge your batteries and improve your own enjoyment of life.  You really do deserve it. Dont feel guilty if you do manage to take some time for yourselves. Even if its just a nice walk and lunch, or a cup of tea and cake. Its not walking away to make sure your own well-being is taken care of.  If you look after yourself first, you will be a better carer for your mother. She is lucky to have such a devoted daughter.

743,Infections," Sorry to hear that you've been going through this. I experienced the same with my Mum, constantly going in and out of hospital with sometimes only a few days in-between. It all came to a head over Easter weekend, earlier this year, when she wasn't responding to treatment for sepsis and we were told that she had hours, possibly days to live. Somehow, against all the odds she pulled through and was discharged just a few days later!  Like your Mum, she had had asuprapubic catheter in for 12 years. The doctors said the site of the catheter looked a little red so could be the source of infection and promptly removed it. Since then she's not had one infection.  Unfortunately she's not strong enough to go through the surgery required to have another fitted so has to wear pads at all times. Although not ideal, it seems to be working out ok for her and is preferable to the constant hospital visits.  Of course, everyone'ssituations are different but it might be worth chatting with someone about whether it could be something to do with the catheter?

751,pip," Yes, its a total nightmare. There are a few things I would suggest everyone keeps in mind.  The line reliably, safely and repeatedly should be used / remembered. Whatever you can or cant do, you need to think about whether you are safe, whether you can do it to the same standard as someone able bodied, and whether you can do it again or need a rest. So its particularly useful for the walking 20/50 metres activity. But its also useful for the daily living activities.  Keep in your mind the Activities and associated Descriptors. If youre not sure what they are, here they are: https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/Global/Migrated_Documents/adviceguide/...  You should score 8 points for the standard rate and 12 points for the enhanced rate for each component.  If you dont know how to fill in the claim form, or the mandatory reconsideration form, or need help with an appeal, try to get help from the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) or another welfare rights organisation.  You should also make sure if possible that you have atleast a basic understanding of the rules. See https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-c...   If you feel that you need/want to know more and/or are completing the forms alone, consider joining https://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk/  Their members only guides are excellent. It costs about 20 per year but its worth it.  Remember  evidence  is key. Whatever you say on your form, try to back up each statement with a written form of evidence. So, use letters from your neurologist, MS nurse, physiotherapist, psychologist, bowel and bladder nurse, GP, carer, anyone else professional or not, who knows you and your physical and/or mental abilities. If you have one, include yoursocial services care plan.  Try not to be combative when completing your forms. Treat the whole exercise as something you are doing to help the assessor and DWP decision maker (remember this is a two stage process, the assessor is not a direct DWPemployee, s/he makes a report;your claim, the evidence you provide,plus the report from the assessor, is used by a DWPdecision maker to decide your claim) to understand who you are and how your disability affects you.  Best of luck to everyone. Its a difficult thing to do, it worries the pants off everyone (me included) and the wait for the decision is hell.  The reconsideration process is still more hellish.

As for MS symptoms causing depression, definitely.  The reason I dont think it could play a role in the onset is that through everything Ive read, while there have been a whole range of factors involved (environment, genetics, vitamin D absorption, exposure to viruses, geography, food even), depression has never been mentioned.  I reckon if you have ongoing symptoms, perhaps from prior relapses, nerve damage or progressive disease, a serious bout of depression could cause your symptoms to get worse. Not that I think being depressed can actually bring on a relapse, although if the research youve read seems to indicate depression sparking off inflammatory activity, then maybe!  And MS symptoms can obviously bring on depression. Thats pretty self evident. Just having a diagnosis of MS could easily cause depression.  I hope youre doing alright eastendgirl.  All the best.

759,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," Hi Purple Pixie  I am in a similar position as you. My husband was diagnosed with MS 4 years ago. Before he was diagnosed he started having mood swings and personality changes so bad that we almost divorced. But then he had a major attack and that's when we found out it was MS. We too were relieved to know what was causing his behavior changes but it still hasn't been easy. He never screams and has never raised a hand to me or our daughter but his words are hurtful. I do the eggshell walking as well and still he takes offense or gets upset with something I say or do daily. It's getting tiring. I keep telling myself this isn't him, it's who he's become because of the disease but that doesn't make it easier.   I wish I could offer you some advice but I think we are in the same boat right now. I'm thinking of asking him to get help, maybe not seeing a therapist but just reading forums such as this one and articles that talk about the emotional changes might help him see that it's him and not me.  I'm still considering though. He gets upset with so much that I say.   I wish you well on this journey. I hope we can persevere like so many other couples who've dealt with MS.

760,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," Hi all  Thank you all for your input  Anon - i will post on the everyday living part and see what advice there is there.    Joanne - you don't sound a misery - I am so glad you went ahead with your holiday and so pleased at how your husband has been so caring. I think it is a journey not only for the MS sufferer and the carer as well and something we need to adjust to at different times. I was always a planner but this disease as shown me that we just have to live a day at a time. You have absolutely nothing to fel guilty about - you didnt give yourself this illness. As for enjoying yourselves - that doesnt have to stop. My husband and I took a short break at the eginning of this week although we came home on Wednesday a little earlier than planned it was lovely. We have 2 teenage children (my mum looked after them) and we did have a good couple of days. Stop blaming yourself. I know its hard but try.    Happy Star - I empathise with you sooooo much. It does get tiring and stressful but I just keep trying to do my best. And i also agree that this disease has made my husand this way at times. But then there are the times when he is the man i married nearly 18 years ago and everything could be ok again for a while. I think trying to let it wash off me whenhe has a mood swing is what i ultimately hope to do, but as i suffer from depression and low self esteem as it is, its really tough going at times. Since my husband was diagnosed people are only to happy to tell me about the amount of marriages, of people they know, have ended in divorce because the carer couldnt cope anymore. I don't want that - i love my husband so much and we have already been through so much. I was so encouraged by the last line of your post and hope like you we can perservere.

761,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," Me again  things are getting worse. There is hardly ever a day now that I am not emotionally abused by my husband and yet I do still love him.  Our daughter has had a lot to cope with the last few years and even though she is a teenager she still likes to cuddle up to me on the sofa in the evenings - we both got yelled at 2 days ago.He told her she was too old for a cuddle and that I was babying her all the time. She was bullied and we had to change schools and the only reassuring thing to her was that cuddle at the end of each day - full scale verbal fight broke out about the way he was raised and the way I was raised etc. I told him to get out and he went to bed. Of course me being me couldn't let it lie and I went upstairs after him. I final got him to realise why having a cuddle meant so much to our daughter after much crying from me and more giving off from him.  the phone rang this evening. Only 2 people who phone us and ""withheld"" comes up on caller display is his mum or my dad. He had the phone but started passing it to me. I asked him just to answer it as it might be his mum. He said it wouldn't be and that if he answered the phone and it was for me he would just hang up! He has been so nasty lately. He'll tell me to ""shut the **** up"", he'll sit with earphones in on his tablet and not talk for a few hours and then it's just foul form and being shouted at all over again. He refuses to see anyone. Says there is nothing wrong. He forgets easily...about some things but seems to remember what he wants. No matter what I do it's wrong.  i have been very I'll myself and while he is technically in ""remission"" he refuses to help me. I am now on morphine for the pain I am in but I don't count.  i have been having a very hard time with 2 people in my family who would have ordinarily been my main strength - but I don't have that any more. I have no one else to turn to. I try to keep things played down for the children's sake but they are old enough to know what's going on...especially our daughter(even though she is younger than her brother)She is the only one who keeps me sane. I would never of course tell her that, she's only 14 and that wouldfar too much pressure for her.  I am attending the pain clinic in the morning for myself but as I am overweight I am pretty sure it will be ""lose weight and we'll treat you then""sort of thing. He doesn't seem to care at all.  he sees his MS nurse on Thursday and while I want to bring it up I am scared to. Do I speak to her in front of him - will she talk to me without him there (as he is the patient not me)?  We have been together since we were 16. That's 22 years now and never until the last year or so did I EVER think we would break up. But I don't know how much more I can cope with. But I love him still...so very very much. I am at my wits end to know what to do.  as usual I have rambled on far too much -sorry  i am very grateful to anyone who takes the time to read this  any and all advice would be greatly appreciated  xxxx ","<p>Me again</p><p>things are getting worse.

764,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," Dear Anonymous(es) and Purple Pixie,  My boyfriend was just diagnosed a few weeks ago and is receiving no treatment yet (seeing the MS Specialist on Jan 14). We've always had quite a passionate relationship so it wasn't unusual for us to argue; but lately the nature of the arguments was not normal, something was definitelyamiss; it wasn't him; he wasn't himself; and what I read above is very helpful. It will help me stay strong for the both of us. I also for the first time feel like I need to wak on eggshells which is uncomfortable for someone feisty like me. I can't wait for any form of treatment to start; I hope there is something the specialist can give him to cope with the physical disability, double vision which causes him imbalance and the mood swings. I wish he could get back to normal sooner rather than later.  What I've learned from the above, and that I am grateful to this forum,is:  I do have some questions still, which I hope you can help me with:  This is proving to be a real test of strength for me - It saddens me deeply to see him like that. It also worries me for the future we have planned togheter. I thought MS was only disabling and I could cope with that but I find myself stumbling on the emotional front.

777,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," I am in a similar situation, and I wanted to ask people not only how they cope with the mood swings &amp; hurtful things that can be said, but also advice - my husband also flicks like a switch from being happy, to horrendous. One minute I feel like the most loved person in the world, but the next either invisible, he ignores me, I'm just like a house elf(!) or like I have done something really bad &amp; he is punishing me, or telling me how vile I am to him, or how angry I make him, or make him feel like nothing, or that he doesn't know why he is with me, or I should go &amp; be with someone else because I'd be happier - which is so far from the truth it's silly.  He seems to not recognise what he is saying, &amp; I know most of the time he doesn't realise that the things he says hurt me, but I don't know how he can seem to not even recall saying them sometimes. Is this normal? Or is it that he doesn't want to think that he's hurt me? I really don't know, &amp; we can't talk about it because that just makes him cross for real.

I think he is scared too, but he has not yet seen his doctor - he is a very stubborn man &amp; doesn't want to be told bad news because knowing him it would make him feel like he is failing. It doesn't matter how much I tell him otherwise, that is just how he sees it.

Lately hes become verbally abusive shouting not letting you tell him the truth about things when hes eating one type of soup which he shouts at you is a different thing altogether is hard to cope with.  He swears a lot and accuses staff of theft etc. Im learning to not bother disagreeing with him anymore but to be quite and just agree. Its hard to ignore and must be so much worse for you taking abuse from your husband. I too like you have fibromyalgia but put my employers needs before my own. You need to learn to walk away from the situation for a few mins to compose yourself and remember its not his usual way of talking to you but its the result of his condition. I cant imagine how it affects you but can only advise that talking about it will help you get it off your chest.

After ringing them they told me that I had not scored enough points. Several weeks later the report finally arrived. With the deadline fast approaching and the humiliation one felt at the time I didn't go for the mandatory reconsideration. The awful lies in the report was like being kicked when down. I jump in the shower for 10 minutes every morning wash my hair and then put my make up on. I wish I had the energy . They also said they would lend me a wheel chair to go to work in. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to get it up a steep flight of stairs (I live in an upstairs flat). After months of no income and savings dwindling I have just found out that you can still go for the mandatory reconsideration up to 13 months as long as you have a good excuse. I was also waiting to see a neurologist at the time and told them so but they were not interested. So I have decided to go for it. So any advice would be helpful.They said silly things like they had tried to phone me several times. No they didn't I checked phone records. They rang me once at 9 am the same time I was at a Doctors appointment.I can prove that as well Sorry to go on a bit. There is lots of other stuff in the report that i can challenge as well.

799,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," All this sounds very familiar. It's so tough and to say it impacts on all aspects of life totally underestimaes the reality of living with MS.I totally relate to your situation. My husband was only diagnosed 12 years ago at the age of 51 after a serious episodic of optic neuritous when he list 90% if vision in his left eye. This was at the end of years of what I thought was dealing with severe stress and resulting in poor mental health. 
My thoughts about MS are that the symptoms are similar to borderline personality disorder. Difficult to say which came first personality or MS! 
My advice is to have a support system around you. Family, work colleagues and try to have an outlet..I'm lucky as I have 3 grown up sons who all have lovely partners and I have grandchildren to care and love. Little thought is given by my husband towards my emotional needs. He is difficult, and lime you, nothing I say or do is right. I tell myself it's not me or him but the disease. But I cannot deny life is a struggle. My husband regularly drinks and on the evenings he obtains he goes to bed at 6.30 and in any event is in bed by 7.3ppm. 
Yes it's rubbish, unfair and although I don't have MS I guess he didn't ask for it either. I do believe people are predisposed to have MS. Everything we have accessed to support and help has made little difference. 
If you Can leave him - do it now. It's unlikely to improve!if you can't then you have to adopt an attitude of acceptance. Acceptance that life will never be normal, I wish my experience could offer you some hope, try and live in the moment, and do not let him make you believe that your life isn't important. The same is true for your children.  ","<p>All this sounds very familiar.

808,Is MS always as bad as it's portrayed?," Personally I think everyone will deal with having MS differently.  I guess it all depends on how it impacts your life, what your life was like before having MS, and how it progresses.  Initially when I was first diagnosed it didn't really hit me that hard because after the initial attack things seemed to settle down within a couple of months and life seemed to go back to ""normal"".  Now though 6 years on, and progressing fairly quickly over the last 18 months it now feels like a totally different disability.  Family, work &amp; social life is hugely effected.  I had a very very active work life prior to having MS, which wasn't really effected until things started progressing, now though its a completely different ball game.  So I think it depends on how you were before MS and how it actually impacts your life now.  Personally YES I think is MS is as bad as it's portrayed, but that's speaking from how it has effected me personally.

814,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," Just browsing the Carers forum to seek support and came across this topic. So much of it resonates. Over the last year or so, my husband (RRMS) has become really difficult to live with at times. He is grouchy, monosyllabic, crabby and makes barbed comments to me. Last year was a year of upheaval and he became stressed, so I can see now that this affected his MS. This year has been less stressful but his relapses continue and his DMT is changing to hopefully keep the relapses at bay. I just wondered if anyone had any tips on how to let such snappiness drift over your head (Ha!) as I find it very hurtful, when I am doing so much for him and making allowances for his behaviour to others. The one thing that I have seen on here is telling him I am leaving the room when he gets like that. I can certainly try that ........ Where do MS carers go for support - is there something for us, to help keep US propped up and able to deal with everything WE have to cope with, caring for someone with this dreadful disease??

The lesson one day was googling so she wanted to find out how to get out of her chair and better and we googled MS in our area and found the centre had a HSCT i think the deep sea thing where you can sit in side. so she rang them when she went home, and her husband took her and over six weeks therapy she was out of her chair and doing physio to gain her strength. One day she walked into her lesson with crutches it was a huge effort for her, but boy i wont ever forget it and she has been my inspiration since i found out i had MS.

818,Is MS always as bad as it's portrayed?," Clearly from all the replies so far, MS effects people very very differently.  Someone who still has good mobility will probably give a different response to someone who's mobility has been affected and is the main problem.  How can someone who's mobility has not been affected by MS know how a person who's mobility has been affectedfully understand how that person really feels, or how their poor mobility actually effects them ?  The reality is that a person can only comment onhow MS affects them as an individual.  Every ones lifestyle is different, before and after MS,every ones degree of MS is different, and how it impacts that person will also be different.  I do agree that you should try to make the best of what you still have, however it can be very difficult if like me you look back and see what youused to have compared to now !  Thats not being negative, it's being a realist !  Thank fully I don't have memory or vision problems, and I can only imagine it's not very nice at all,and must have an impact on that persons lifein one way or another, but that's all I can do, is imagine !  As I've already mentioned up until 18 months ago I was still fairlypositive that my MS wouldn't impact mine and my families life ifit stayed at the level it was (wishful thinking), but today even though I still try to get to work and do as much as I possibly can, life now is completely different to what it was just 18 months ago.  Theres a young chap who's on the same Simvastin trial as me, he's a full-time wheel chair user, has a colostomy bag andhas to self catheterise, his mobility is shot, he was self employed with his is ownvery successful company.  He's now on benefits struggling to make ends meet, he's 35 and has3 kids.  He was diagnosed with MS 12years ago, for 10years heheld everything together, struggled with his mobility a bit but fought through it, 2 years ago out of the blue everything changed, he progressed very quickly.  As others have mentioned MS is unpredictable, you can be very upbeat about it and grasp life with both hands, and just hope it stays at a manageable level.  That's what my attitude used to be like, and certainly like the young chap I've mentioned.  Please don't think I'm a doom &amp; gloom negative person, I'm really not, but I am a realist .  After all, I do feel that I'vegained pretty good experience over the years, and have seenfirst hand how MS effects people so differently, especially as myself, sister and now 2 cousins (1 only very recently diagnosed) all have this sh*ty disability.

819,How to cope with my husbands moos swings," I take some comfort in knowing that its not just me who experiences this hurtful and unpleasant behaviour from their husband in my case of nearly 40 years. I won't lie, in the past year after his diagnosis of some 13 years ago now, I have come close to walking away or asking him to leave. The main. Reason that stops me is our grown up adult children and the grandchildren. Like my husband none if us asked for this cruel condition to ruin our lives. So I keep everything as balanced as I can. I try and understand the true impact on my husband, the loss similar to bereavement, for all if us. I try and see the unpleasant behaviour often only directed at me, as is perfectly charming to other family and friends, as a result of the mental pain and anguish he is experiencing. I do myself often have outbursts of my feelings but always where I'm out of his or anyones earshot. A temporary fix I guess. 
It's tough. In my husbands case it's like living with someone with a behaviour personality disorder. He has no recognition apparently that he is difficult, it's always my fault for being unkind and disagreeable. To say he could have an argument with himself in a room on his own, is pretty much accurate. The physical and mobility issues are insignificant compared to the mental health issues. In addition to all this he is alcohol dependant and drinks most nights and then when he has a night off binge drinks. Not sure there is much hope of it improving. I'd like to think he will wake up and get the point, but I know its unlikely.All a bit sad really. Its so hard. Lots of professional intervention has proved absolutely useless, as you have to recognise that you are unwell and want to change, but as he see's me and the rest if the world at fault it's all a futile waste of time and a waste of nhs resources.

822,Is MS always as bad as it's portrayed?," As others have said, MS is a disease that seems to be unique for each person. If you'd have asked us in 2011 how bad my wife's MS was we'd have said it was well managed. She was RR, on beta interferon, could walk etc etc. She started going downhill gradually during 2012 (the odd fall in the street). By 2013 she was having to walk outside with a stick. By 2015 she's in a wheelchair outside, but can still get around the house by holding on to walls. Still having falls, but can get herself up.  Now, 2019, she is 99% dependent upon me for everything. No mobility. Can't turn herself in bed. Struggles to sit up straight on a chair most days. Has some movement in her right arm, but the past 2 weeks even this has been failing her and I have had to feed her a few times. The cliff she has fallen off in just a few years is scary, and has been fast - much faster than we ever expected based on what you read online.  Also worth noting though, until recently we didn't go on to forums. We were the 'healthy' ones who you didn't meet (or at least never knew she had MS).  She fights every day. She's a real fighter. But we don't know what the next day, week, month, year will bring. Live life to the full whist you can as you never know what's around the corner!

829,Diet," I think before starting any diet of exclusion i.e. dairy and gluten people should be tested to see if they are actually sensitive to it. I was told that by a diatician. I had blood tests for allergy etc, and well it came up with some really odd things. I was gluten senstive, oat and rye, and brewers yeast and bakers yeast lol.....green beans, bananas, these were sensitivity though about 2 in the range, weirdly enough i find eating bananas gives me bloat.  anyway i am gluten free as oats and rye was just a 2 on sensitive i do each occasionally. I came up with a low grade lactose intolerance and funny enough i just dont like milk, so i drink KOKO milk which is fortified with b12 and vitD, and my fatigue levels did get better on that. also i lost weight when i went gluten free more the fact there isnt much you can eat without it in lol. Oh yes and SOYA bad so i try not to touch anything with that. although thats hard as its even in chocolate.  Now my daughter was overweight always tired and went on a ketone diet and six months later she looked brilliant i have to say and started riding again. she has fibro and M.E.  I was shocked as it was radical yet she always seemed to eat and more i thought.  Now she has switched to fully Vegan, she has put weight back on, is always tired and doesnt feel well.  i told her to go back ketone but she wont.  there are so many diets out there. I dont think they help any particular disease i think good healthy food (I eat mediterrean), supports our immune system. which then makes us feel better.  eating garbage is not good for us, eating good is.  i dont go with all this organic stuff. I have a friend with an allotment who grows all own food and chickens for eggs and has MS and her diet of organic has made difference to how she feels.  the trouble with organic it is expensive so people buy less i would rather eat more veg and fruit in my diet so chose not to go organic unless i get some of my stuff from friends who grow their own. we grew our own fruit and veg so i ate that and had chickens too so all organic. i still grow strawberry in baskets.  I think its a personal thing if you feel it helps no harm no fowl.  but no garbage is the answer lol. x ","<p>I think before starting any diet of exclusion i.e. dairy and gluten people should be tested to see if they are actually sensitive to it.

832,Coping with cognitive difficulties," Hi, I care for my mum who has SPMS, I'm finding it REALLY hard at the moment and I really need to rant a bit. Hopefully someone might be able to give me some advice too. My mum was diagnosed with RRMS 34 years ago, which turned into secondary progressive 25 years ago.  She has many physical symptoms (trouble with balance, fine motor skills, bladder and bowels) but it's the cogitive symptoms that I find really hard to deal with.   It's difficult for me to even describe her cognitive symptoms because I feel that I just don't have the vocabulary to do so. But I'll give it a go........ Basically, over the last 25 years she's become a totally different person. First of all she has lost all ability to relate to or empathise with other people. When I was a young child she was a very affectionate and responsive mother to my sister and I and she was friendly and empathetic with other people but when her MS became progressive, she lost the ability to do those things. Now she takes no interest in my life or my sisters or anyone elses. She is totally incapable of considering other people's feelings. She has lost all but one of her friends and family relationships are fraught. Secondly, she has difficulties with memory and understanding what's going on. She often makes things up (invents events, denies events, imagines conversations etc etc). Thirdly, she is often angry and depressed - her anger often causes her to blow things out of proportion - for instance yesterday she screamed and wailed hysterically and slammed doors for half an hour because the recycling wasn't collected. Lastly she doesn't recognise her own illness and is extremely hostile about accepting help or care - she refuses to recognise many of her symptoms, refuses to recognise that she is deteriorating and might need additional help in the future. She lies to healthcare professionals (sometimes because she can't remember, sometimes because she feels put on the spot, sometimes to deliberately decieve them because she feels it will help her regain some control). I'm sure there are other things too but I can't think of them just now. All that makes it sound as if I'm blaming her and I'm not. I do realise that these are symptoms of her illness caused by the MS and are no different.  Like I said, I feel I don't actually have the vocabulary to describe it accurately.  At the moment my major worries are food and money.  She won't eat a proper breakfast or dinner. I cook or prepare her lunch every day and leave her to heat it up.The rest of the day she eats biscuits (and sometimes a piece of toast). In the last two years she is also refusing to eat her lunch. I find that she will just eat potatoes or she will cut a chicken breast into 8 pieces and eat one piece everyday. This is not a physical issue - it isn't that she has no appetite or physically can't do it. It's that mentally she convinces herself that this is the right thing to do. At the moment I consider it a good week when she has 3 or 4 proper meals and lives the rest of the time on biscuits. I like to cook things in large batches and freeze in individual portions - sometimes she gets so hungry that she'll eat 7 or 8 portions of something I'm cooking (that I'd intended to freeze) but she won't accept that the problem lies with her not eating properly. I have tried everything I can think of (including planning and cooking 3 meals a day for her and trying lots of smaller meals instead) but at the suggestion of any change she becomes aggressive and hostile.   Also, she can't deal with money anymore but won't admit it. She has very few clothes and a few days ago I was trying to encourage her to buy a new dress (for 30 pounds, which she can afford) she screamed at me that she couldn't afford it and then half an hour later she went on the internet and brought a set of 6 garden chairs for 500 pounds. I tried to explain to her that if she spent 500 pounds it would empty her bank account and she wouldn't have any money for food or bills, not to mention that she already owns garden chairs. After a huge argument she let me cancel the order for the chairs. But this kind of thing has happened before and I know that it will mean that next time she will lie to me about spending money and then she will be shocked and angry when her bank account is overdrawn. If she would only collaborate with my sister and I then she could retain a lot of her independence but the way things are I feel like I will have no choice but to invoke the power of attorney and stop her accessing her own money.  I find that healthcare professionals are very uninterested in the cognitive aspects of MS - they are endlessly supportive and engaged with the physical symptoms but I feel that when I describe cognitive symptoms they don't even hear what I'm saying. The MS nurse if very dismissive when I try to explain all this. A few months ago with went through an occupational health assemement and mum convinced the OT that I was imagining all this and that a lot of it was my fault. It seems to me that severe cognitive problems are not as rare with MS as it is generally claimed. I feel like there is absolutely no help available at all.  Thank you to anyone who has read this little rant. If anyone has any advice at all I would really really welcome it. Is anyone else dealing with this too?

833,My husband with PPMS losing himself," Hi I'm new to this so sorry if I make a mistake. My husband was diagnosed 13years ago with primary progressive ms but they said he probably had it for a few years earlier but didnt know. He struggled to keep working but 8yrs ago had to give it up because he was finding it hard to walk, he is now in a wheelchair and his limbs are solid and his neck is getting stiff now too.

My husband was diagnosed 13years ago with primary progressive ms but they said he probably had it for a few years earlier but didnt know. He struggled to keep working but 8yrs ago had to give it up because he was finding it hard to walk, he is now in a wheelchair and his limbs are solid and his neck is getting stiff now too.

835,My husband with PPMS losing himself," Hi,  I only saw your post this afternoon and I hope it's not too late to reply. I don't know why you haven't had more replies by now, this Forum is usually so supportive. It is very hard watching the person you married become so ill.  Your isolation comes through quite clearly in your post so it seems that you're not getting much support from family or friends. Does your husband have any mates you could call on to help take him out of himself?  I can't make any predictions about your husband's MS but what you should brace yourself for is taking on too much on by yourself. You should be able to get carers in to give you a break from time to time. Contact your local authority's Adult Social Care team and ask for an assessment.  Please come back to us, I don't want you to feel that we don't understand because we do.  Best wishes,

837,Ended Relationship," Hi everyone, thank you for this great forum. The reason I'm writing this post is just to get my feelings out. I hope you understand, comments are welcome of course.  I don't have MS, but was in a relationship that was getting serious when she found out she had MS, or probably, I don't really know. She (39)has 4 kids, I (42) have 2. She ended our relationship quickly, I didn't get to choose, but I was (and still am) willing to continue to see if we would have worked out, regardless of health problems. It had looked promising.  Her reasons, like many others here are very rational. I understand and respect them -to protect me and my kids from the burden of the disease, to focus her energy where it needs to be, on her health and her kids while she figures out what life is like now. In the meantime, I've focused my energy on reading all about it, what life could be like etc., what would I be getting myself into and I feel selfish for wanting the relationship when she obviously has too much on her plate. I would like to be beside her, to help and care, but can't. I feel selfish for considering not being with her. She said I'd have no trouble finding a fun, beautiful, healthy person, which hurt so badly and if that does eventually happen, I'll feeling guilty I'm sure, even though I didn't have the choice. I've seen the Dr. for depression and now am on medication for that. I can imagine if it's doing that to me, what it must do to her.  She says she does have a great support network. I imagine it is completely overwhelming to receive the diagnosis, nevermind deal with life's other issues. Her having support is the only thing that gives me some comfort about her decision.  I feel like the biggest hurt is the feeling of not being able to provide the love and support to someone you care about when they are in need. Then the selfish feelings, what's most important right now is that she quickly implements her Drs. plans and doesn't have me to distract her. Nevermind the feelings that my problems are nothing compared to hers, or many others, and guilty for not ""just getting the big picture"". ","<p>Hi everyone, thank you for this great forum.

838,1st Post," Hi all, first post here so may end up as a ramble - sorry in advance!  I'm the only carer for my partner who has had MS now for about 25 years (since she was mid 20's). Initially RR but now moved into 2ndP. The past few years she's gone from being able to walk with a stick to now not being able to stand at all. This means I have to dress her, transfer her from chair to bed, toilet, wheelchair etc. She has constant spasms, has started to choke when she eats, has a supra-pubic catheter following months of bladder issues.  Thankfully her mind is still as sharp as a pin!  We used to have such an active, fun life but now we're mostly house bound. Most of our friends live 2 hours plus away, although they will come to help any weekend we ask them. I used to work but had to give this up as I can't leave her alone at home for more than an hour. Thankfully we have some savings to live on at the moment, although the downside of this is the council have zero interest in helping us.  MS Nurse, physios, local GP, district nurses though are thankfully superb.  What scares us though is where her illness is going. She has gone downhill so fast so quickly. Just 18 monthsago I was working away from home and staying away nights, now I'm reluctant to go to the local shops as I'm scared to leave her alone too long. Everything you read online says MS doesn't kill, yet we are so scared about the drastic drop in health in such a small amount of time that we can't help but have very dark days.  What should we expect? What can we do? Anything we should be looking out for or be wary of?  Today is a good day for us. Some days are very bad. Thanks for listening.

839,1st Post," Hi there,  I think you are asking how will your wife's MS develop. You will understand that that is something that even the professionals won't be able to answer, but I do recognise the concerns that you have. As someone with PPMS it's something that I dwell on occasionally but the worse-case scenarios don't bear thinking about for too long.  The best advice I can offer is ""to hope for the best and plan for the worst"". Excuse me if this seems over simplified. Have you made adaptations to your home, not just for your wife's current needs but for any increase in disability in the future?  Contact your local authority and ask for the Adult Social Care department. I believe that they have a Statutory Duty to prepare a Care Assessment of your needs.  Have you applied for PIP? It won't solve every problem but may help living easier.  There are probably more that I haven't thought of but a Citizens Advice Bureau will be able to help.

840,1st Post," Thanks for reply Anthony. Yes, we do hope for the best but try to plan for the worst. Problem with this illness though is guessing what the worst might even be - what we thought bad might look like 3 years ago is different to what we think now, and almost certainly what we'll think in 6 months time. So awful for those of you who actually suffer. We have made adaptations to the home, but the frustration is money we spent 2 years ago was effectively wasted as we can no longer use those adaptations in the house - had we known how fast the illness would have taken hold we would probably have made more drastic changes initially.

MS is such a beast of a disease, we all live with the uncertainty of the future and dread the inevitable progression.  I had my diagnosis changed from RR to SP a few years ago but last year suddenly started relapsing again, so Im now either Progressive Relapsing or RR. My disabilityprogression isquite severe as Im virtually unable to walk, have to use ISC to empty my bladder, had a colostomy 2 years ago and generally need help to dress. But I can still transfer and can be left alone, even though there are times when if I go to the loo I cant re-dress myself so if Im alone, I end up with my trousers round my knees at best!

848,1st Post," Hi Sue  thanks for your response and advice. My wife has PIP at full level for both components. She is wheelchair bound all day and can longer transfer between wheelchair and bed/toilet/etc. She can no longer dress herself and I help her shower, brush teeth etc. She's even lost the ability to turn herself in bed - she needs to wake me up a few times a night to do this as we don't want her too long in one position in case she gets sores.  We do have a good OT who helps, but the progression of the illness has been so fast these past 2 years that some adaptions we have put in, for example a stair lift, are now (only a year later) impossible for her to use on her own so I lift her on.  The only benefit to all this is it keeps me fit! Some days I feel like a bodybuilder LOL Plus, every time we transfer between chairs etc it gives us a chance to get close for a quick cuddle :) ","<p>Hi Sue</p><p>thanks for your response and advice.

And that you were a carer for K until perhaps your own needs became more needful of help and maybe now that she has a live in carer no longer needs you?  One problem that affects many of us with MS is cognitive deficits. This can of course manifest itself in an uncaring, lack of empathy for others. Which is perhaps what has happened with K.

I usually keep choices to a minimum but even then it can be a minefield.

Last week she decided she wanted abowl of chips with curry sauce, when Iput that down she said she had asked for fish and refused to eat the chips and curry sauce. Which wasn't even one of the original choices and she doesn't even like fish...... We've tried meal planning, diaries, big calendars and even technology and nothing seems to help.  She also refuses to spend any money and often we end up going without due to me spending all my money on the bills. She also needs new clothes due but refuses to spend the money. She thinks she only has a little money but truth be told she has significantly more but refuses to give anyone access to it to help her.I used to get her to go into her bank and transfer money over to my account but she would tell her mum on the phone I was stealing her money so I stopped doing that. It also doesn't help that she gets the tax credits for the kids which she's adamant is her money and won't let me touch that either.  I also feel there is so little help for this symptom of M.S. when I spoke to the M.S. nurse she dismissed it, when I spoke to the neurologist about it he only said that it was common and that most sufferers don't realisethey even have an issue.

863,Coping with cognitive difficulties," I am now helping my daughter who has rrms but up until 18 months ago was a full time carer for my husband who had a rare form of early onset dementia. He died in December 2015.  Firstly, I am struck by how some of the cognitive issues with MS are similar to those we faced. It is all to do with part of the brain being disabled by illness. At first I got frustrated by my husband being unable comprehend some mental processes, especially as this was inconsistent, that is he could do it some days but not others. When his mobility worsened I did not expect him to magically be able to manage steps because he had done it previously but loss of cognitive function was a harder thing to understand.  What I would say, is after many years of coping with it, that his good days were a bonus but his bad days were something we just had to both remain calm and get through. I was lucky in that right up to the end he never lost his empathy, but there were problems with eating and drinking. Some things he had liked no longer tasted the same and some things he had disliked, especially sweet foods, he developed a liking for.  He did at times get angry but I think this was a response to being unable to make others understand what it was like in his new situation and perhaps being unable to make sense of it himself.  In my husband's case, the first area of the brain to be affected by his rare dementia was the visual cortex and this I think is easier to cope with and understand than some other parts which came later. I am lucky that so far my daughter has no mental issues other than brain fog.  I think from my experience, physical disabilities are easier to cope with than mental ones, both for the carer and the person being cared for.  There are no easy answers to this .

Having said all this there is very little help to be found, all ideas are available online and via sympathetic health care teams, but it all comes down to the sufferer ultimately, how willing or able they are to help themselves, but unfortunately, like my husband, he is unable to understand his own problems.

I'm told it is extremely effective, and I do find it comfortable, although where I see the true value is having the ability to swap between the two types of cushion, 'cos if you sit on any one surface for long enough you're going to suffer!</p><p>That's what I do anyway!</p><p>Elaine (Living in Folkestone, born in Wallasey!)<img alt=""wink"" height=""23"" src=""https://community.mssociety.org.uk/sites/all/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/wink_smile.png"" width=""23""></p><p></p>",05 Jan  2020 at 2:28 pm,#3,418487,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/comment/418487#comment-418487,hitfl,,,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/users/hitfl,,,

884,PPMS Fasting mimicking regime," Is there anyone out there who he has had experiencewith a fasting mimicking regime?  I, first,got excited by this when I saw an articlein a newspaper https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/02/diabetes-drug-offers-hope-new-treatment-multiple-sclerosis   The underlyingresearch paper https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(19)30350-9 was followed by a number of newspapers.  On the face of it, it is about a drug,Metformin. You cannot get it from a doctor for MSbut that is ok because, if you read the paper,the drug merely is there to replace a fast.  Fasting is the key to 1. stopping theimmune system attacking thenervous systemand 2. replacingthethe myelin sheaths around the nerves in the brain.  It is true that I am not a rat but,since there is no treatment for PPMS, I thought that my research into fastingwas worthwhile.  Neurologists cannot suggest a fastbecause it is not backed up with research on humans but that is years away and I do not have years.  Anyway, I am no good at diets so I bought the Prolondiet suggested by Prof. Longo. https://youtu.be/dJVF4sCylsw . Incidentally, he does not benefit financially.  I don't like the word diet as it suggests that you are doing it to lose weight. I am not. It may have that effect but onlyon the side. I prefer ""regime"".  There are, as far as I can see,two things to understand--firstly it is not the fast which produces the result but the ""refeeding"" afterwards and,for that,you need to go onto a Mediterranean type eating regime.  Anyway, I am now onto my second monthly fastand I wanted to know if anybody else had had any experience ofthis.  I would say that I feel better generally but I still have brain fog and balance issues.  Apparently, it will take a few months to see real changes.

Diet/Regime does have an effect on our wellbeing, but not sure if it can halt the illness altogether... 
Im looking for a diet as well at the moment and found this [Edited] 
The Charit Berlin does at the moment a clinical trial to look at 3 different diets (fasting, ketogen and vegetarian/antiinflammatory), so its not completely nonesense obviously. Of course (as apparantly always) the trial does not consider people with ppms, but hey, we have not much to lose if you ask me, so i will do research on diets and decide for one... cant wait years neither. Had a look at vitamin d as well, sound promising too... not sure if its possible to combine a diet/regime with lots of vitamin d supplements...  ","<p>Hi Scots man, Swiss man here.<br>

This will mean others will see your post when theyfilterthe forum to show posts about that topic.  Tagging your posts also means we can signpost people to the forum from the rest of thewebsite. We can pull titles of forum posts into related forum posts lists on relevant pages.  For example, we might set it up so the titles of posts tagged with emotional support appear a page about coping with diagnosis.

901,Absolutely Petrified!!!," Hi,  As per my title I am absolutely petrified right now and convinced I have all the symptoms of MS.   About 10 days ago I noticed that I was getting numbness in my left foot which carried on for a few days and continued on and off up my leg. On Friday I woke up in the middle of the night and was completely numb down my left side which freaked me out and I took myself to A&amp;E where I had a CT scan and some blood tests before being admitted to the stroke ward as the only thing they could think of was that I had a possible minor stroke. They advised I needed an MRI scan however as it was now the weekend and I wouldn't be able to have onethey felt they could discharge me and have one as an urgent outpatient which I am having this weekend.  My symptoms currently are a strange feeling in my left leg including on and off pins and needles and numbness. When I first noticed this I also had pins and needles in my face and felt like I was dribbling as well as having issues on a couple of occasions getting my words out.Over the last couple of days my feet particularly my left one has been freezing cold also. My left buttock is also numb and sorry to much information but I feel like the left side of my vagina is too. I do not think I have had a stroke as I did not loose strength at all.   ive obviously been checking my symptoms online and convinced I have MS which is scaring me!! I don't know what to do. I expect I need to wait for my head MRI on Sunday and the results as this should pick up possible ms?   sorry I just need to talk to someone,    thank you, Jo ","<p>Hi,</p><p>As per my title I am absolutely petrified right now and convinced I have all the symptoms of MS.<br></p><p>About 10 days ago I noticed that I was getting numbness in my left foot which carried on for a few days and continued on and off up my leg.

I'm sorry, I can't answer your question...but I also have vision problems that come and go. I was diagnosed with relapsing MS only a few weeks ago.

I'm hoping to ask this question when I see my neurologist next month.

907,MS doesnt usually cause stiffness in joints?," Hi Miss H , 
Just wanted to reply and reach out to you to say youre not going mad . I was diagnosed with highly active rrms in feb 2007 (although I can track symptoms back to 2004). 
In August 2011 I had a massive relapse and I had chronic stiffness and intense pain in my knees. I still suffer with this today , although its much better than what it was. My knees get very stiff and dont bend easily, and I can only stand for about 10 minutes, any longer and I experience achey joints. Ive mentioned this to my neurologist, MS nurse and my GP , and they all fob me off saying ms doesnt cause joint problems or pain ??? 
Ive had blood tests to see if I might have rheumatoid arthritis but this comes back negative with a negative ANA test. Im absolutely fed up with doctors giving me their text book answers. I know of other people who have experienced joint pains with their ms.   I also get cramping and tightness in my feet , sometimes they feel like their in a tight vice and I cant flex my foot freely (if that makes any sense lol !)  Anyway just wanted to say youre not on your own , good luck with starting treatment etc.  ","<p>Hi Miss H ,<br>

914,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI," As some of you know, I often answer posts on here asking for help to understand what a neurologists letter or radiologists report means. What you probably dont know is that it is a pretty time-consuming task and, every time I find myself typing the same stuff, I say to myself, I absolutely must put something together that I can copy and paste from!  Well, I have finally done it :-)  It occurred to me that some of you might be interested in reading the whole thing and that you might use it as a starter for 10, to give you more confidence to go and do some research on your own when you come across something in a letter or report that doesnt make any sense.  Ill still be happy to help, especially as the stuff Im posting here only really scratches the surface, so dont take this as me telling everyone to start doing it on their own :-)  I think the whole document is too long to post in one go, so Im going to do a reply below this about the brain and a reply after that about MRI. My apologies  the spinal cord is noticeable by its absence. Maybe Ill add something about that at a later date.  A couple of caveats. I have made this as easy as I could. That means that an expert would no doubt shake their head at bits and laugh their heads off at other bits, but on the whole I think its an acceptable explanation. However, I am not a neurologist or a radiologist; my knowledge comes from a background of neuroscience research using MRI followed by a lot of self teaching. In other words, please dont assume that this is fault-free!  I hope you find it helpful.  Karen x  PS This would never make a best seller list - prepare to be rather bored!!!

926,Sensitive hearing," Hi Everyone.  I hope you're all okay. I need advice please. Hearing sensitivity isn't a new thing, where every sound is magnified and extra loud. This usually happens in both ears and only for a day or two. I've now had this for over two weeks. It's only in my left ear but all sounds are REALLY loud, distorted and accompanied by a whistling sensation. I can't tell you how distressing it is. The fridge, freezer, tumble drier, washing machine etc are driving me insane, and I can't cope with voices, the tv or radio. The ringing phone or dog barking can bring me close to tears.  I went to the GP yesterday and nearly fell off my chair when she hit the tuning fork. She checked my ears and can't see anything, so thinks it's probably neurological. Normally I put headphones on and listen to a book as I can set the volume low and just hear one voice which is calming. Obviously that's not going to work now. I'm wearing ear plugs in my left ear and can't leave the house but I can't do that long term..  Does anyone have any suggestions or have you experienced anything like this lasting so long?  I'm supposed to spend this weekend in a barn helping with a live nativity, so lots of people and animals in a huge echoing space. Can you imagine anything worse when your ears are sensitive?

When I have googled how quickly it progresses, I have found out that it is generally a steady progression.

Twenty years, for someone diagnosed in their late fifties feels hopeful although obviously it would be great to not have the diagnosis at all. However, both these findings feel contradictory.  It would really help to hear of people's experiences of progression, if at all possible.Any other information that you have found out would be greatly appreciated; the MS nurse has been beyond useless!

About 5 years ago at the age of 52, I had a very strange sensation in my thigh, just like someone was hugging it tightly.  At the same time I developed one heck of a flue type bug which took me 4 months to recover from  During this period I was experiencing strange numbness in my legs and back, after around a year those symptoms diminished.  The next symptoms I started with were severe dizzy spells,which I still get but not as often or as bad.  Then I started getting electric shocks in my brain, like a thousand little shocks for a second or two.  Next symptom to develop was a hearing issue, I started to become very sensitive to certain noises, which can be very painful.  The next symptoms to appear was I lost my sense of smell.  Recently and the reason I started to research all of these symptoms is now wake up everyday aching all over.  Dr's have investigated all these over the last few years and are unable to offer me any explanation, although they did say when I had the flu symptoms/strange leg and back problem I may have had an infection of the spinal chord.  I haven't yet discussed the body aches as this has only appeared about a month ago  I am now approaching 57 and do like to keep fit at the gym  So my current issues are super sensitive hearing, odd hearing, loss of sense of smell, body aching all over, slight dizzy spells.

I want to see it this is similar to anyone else that has been diagnosed or not. Starting in April of 2019 I started having dizzy spells. Not like spinning, just feeling a little off balance. I went to my GP and she contributed it to hormones (I was a few months post partumat that point.)A couple months later I started having pressure in my ears and behind my nose at times. I went back and she thought it was my inner ear. Told me to take Claritin and Flonase which I did. The dizziness subsided when I take these religiously. Then in October I started having trouble focusing when I was driving or riding in a car. It also happened when I was in big dept stores. Went to an optometrist where my eyes were dilated. I was told I had great vision and the back of my eyes looked very healthy. Well, 3 weeks ago I started having tingling (pins and needles)pop up at random areas in my body. They last a few minutes and stop. Usually moving to a different area. At that time it was in my hands and arms bilaterally and on my face. Went back to GP and she found my BP was elevated and put me on a BP Med and some Prozac for anxiety. The Prozac makes my anxiety worse so I'm not taking it right now. The tingling wentaway for 3 weeks and now it's back in my hands and feet. Happens for a few minutes then goes away, coming back shortly after.. Seems much worse if I'm concentrating on it.Of course I'm googling every single symptom I'm having and every time something about MS comes up. I'm driving myself crazy and I feel like I'm being dismissed by my doctor. Does this sound like how anyone else's MS started?Thanks in advance and sorry this is so long.

Last week I suddenly had a relapse and was prescribed a 5 day course of steroids (500mg each day). Certainly sorted out the overwhelming fatigue (insomnia city!), but physical symptoms still there.  My questions are, when I stop the steroids in 2 days time, will the fatigue return? Is it normal for a relapse to come completely out of the blue? And as i have a positive MRI, positive lumbar puncture and a CIS, is this relapse the final piece in the jigsaw?? Very confusing!

952,Questions about steroids for relapse,"  I'm afraid the return of the fatigue is quite likely        Steroids make a lot of people temporarily hyper, but it's usually short-lived. Of course, the fatigue may have been mainly to do with the relapse in which case, if the steroids have reduced the inflammation, they may have reduced the fatigue too. Let's hope so!      Unfortunately, yes, relapses can come suddenly out of the blue. I think most relapses come on more gradually (maybe over a day or two), but they can just suddenly be there too.       Whether or not this relapse means that your diagnosis will be confirmed depends on why the neuro didn't confirm it already. Probable MS means that you either hadn't had multiple relapses or that you didn't have multiple lesion locations (or sufficient lesions on MRI vs the criteria). If your MRI met the criteria, but you had only had one relapse previously, then yes, this relapse will probably mean that your dx will be changed to MS.       I hope the steroids do the trick and speed up your recovery :-)      Karen x  ","<p><span>I'm afraid the return of the fatigue is quite likely <img alt=""letdown"" height=""35"" src=""http://www.mssociety.org.uk/sites/all/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/LetDown.png"" width=""35""></span></p><p></p><p><span>Steroids make a lot of people temporarily hyper, but it's usually short-lived.

955,Lesions but clear lumbar," Hi all, I am new to this forum but hoping others experiences can help me to understand where my diagnosis is going.  In a short recap of my medical history, have had pins and needles in my hands and feet for a number of years, was initially told it was carpol tunnel. However symptoms got worse over the years and ended up with numbness in my arms, heavy feeling in all limbs, falling over all the time and dropping everything.  Went back to my docs and had nerve conduction tests - neuro surgeon said that there was slowness in signal but based on other symptoms he wanted to refer me to neurologist.  I had a great neurologist who I explained all symptoms to - she asked lots of questions and did a few tests there and then and then instantly sent me for an MRI scan. MRI confirmed lesions on the brain. I had of course started to google symptoms and by this time was pretty sure myself that it was MS. Neurologist then sent me for lumbar puncture. Her words were "" i am almost 100% sure this is MS but want to do a lumbar puncture to connect all the dots""  After the most horrendous lumbar puncture procedure (almost 4hours bent over whilst they tried to get the tap in) my GP and I received a letter from another neurologist who said that lumbar was clear and that he did not believe it was MS. He advised that migraines I had had as a teen (i m now 38) were the cause of the lesions and that the symptoms I was currently experiencing are secondary to the migraines. This neuro has never seen me and has written off the diagnosis my first neurohad provided based on lumbar only. It turns out my old neurololgist has now left and this other guy is my new point of contact.  As I said i had migraines in my teens but they are very rare now. I now get headache pain at the back of my head near my neck and my eyes are sensitive esp to the light) but not like with a migraine.  I was devastated (i thought i was close to getting some help and support) and went back to my doctors. The dr was furious that this neuro could make this diagnosis without even seeing me and has written to him to say so. I have a follow up appt in Feb, where I am taking a full diary of my symptoms that I am having on a daily basis in the hopes that I can prove to him that my symptoms are not secondary, but are life changing.  I have had to change my car so that I have an automatic with adaptive cruise control as my legs go numb if i drive for too long. I can't do the weekly shop anymore as I get too tired, I can't walk my dogs or run in the park with my kids as i get too tired. I cut my hands and burn myself on the oven most days as I do not feel the heat and I have dropped more crockery and glasses in the last year I have lost count. If anything is on the side my arms are like a magnet and seem to knock it off!! I can't walk up the stairs to my bedroom without feeling exhausted at the end of it......These symptoms are not in my head and have changed and are changing my life all the time.

957,Lesions but clear lumbar," Hello  What a horrible time you've been having. Quite how a neurologist can rule MS out on the basis of a lumbar puncture, I don't know. Have a look at https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/lumbar-puncture The MS Trust provide reliable information so can be trusted. Within this webpage, it explains that 80 to 95% of people with MS test positive forOligoclonalbands on their lumbar puncture. Forgive my maths, but Iread this as up to 20% of people with MS test negative.  So testing negative for one test isn't the same as testing negative for MS (unless it's a complete head and full spineMRIscan).  I don't know if you should take this as positive news of not. Many people would find it more frightening than reassuring. But if you've suffered symptom after symptom that could be explained by one diagnosis, failing to be diagnosed is more fearful than being diagnosed.  I think that having a complete diary to take with you to your next appointment is a good plan. Don't expect to be able to go through absolutely every symptoms one by one. Your neurologist will have his own way of conducting an examination. So long as he does a physical examination you shouldn'thave too much to worry about. He will have your previousneurological examination,MRIexaminations, other test results and his own examination to go by in addition to your history.  You may want to keep in mind the McDonald Criteria for diagnosing MS. Have a look at https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/lumbar-puncture This states that for MS diagnosis, what's needed is dissemination in time and place. To show this, an LP can be used, but it's not required.  Best of luck for your next appointment, hopefully you can develop more faith in this neurologist following that.

960,What to expect," Hello NickE, and welcome to the forum.  I'm sorry to read what an awful time you're having with your MS. As you may already know, the condition is quite variable and everyone's experience is different. I'm afraid no one can predict what will happen next, but there are many on this forum who will have experienced similar symptoms to your own, so you are amongst friends and will be understood here.  As to which variant of the disease you have, I think it's probably a bit early for the consultant to be certain; I wasn't told for a very long time. The medics seem to need to monitor your progress for a while before deciding whether you are PPMS, RRMS or SPMS; I don't think it is apparent simply from the test results, but I could be wrong.  I'm intrigued to read that you were treated at an open MS clinic, I've never heard of one of those, but I live in a rural area and am guessing that was in a city.  You seem to be seeing all the right medics and getting tests and treatments, so just hold in there. It might be useful to keep a timeline of main events and any new symptoms (just a summary) to take with you when you next see your neurologist, so you don't forget anything important; memory alone can often let you down. Also make a note of any questions you want to ask.  Meanwhile, keep reading the websites of the MS Society and the MS Trust, they are by far the most reliable sources of information. And keep an eye on this forum, we all share experiences of symptoms, treatments and just living with MS.

The medics seem to need to monitor your progress for a while before deciding whether you are PPMS, RRMS or SPMS; I don't think it is apparent simply from the test results, but I could be wrong.</p><p>I'm intrigued to read that you were treated at an open MS clinic, I've never heard of one of those, but I live in a rural area and am guessing that was in a city.</p><p>You seem to be seeing all the right medics and getting tests and treatments, so just hold in there. It might be useful to keep a timeline of main events and any new symptoms (just a summary) to take with you when you next see your neurologist, so you don't forget anything important; memory alone can often let you down. Also make a note of any questions you want to ask.</p><p>Meanwhile, keep reading the websites of the MS Society and the MS Trust, they are by far the most reliable sources of information. And keep an eye on this forum, we all share experiences of symptoms, treatments and just living with MS.</p><p>Hoping things improve soon,</p><p>Ben</p>",19 Dec  2019 at 7:18 pm,#2,418055,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/comment/418055#comment-418055,ben,I have MS,,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/users/ben,,,

982,Embarrasing Problem," Yes I too enjoy ultra urgency on occasion. It had a significant impact on my life. My MS nurse referred me to a continence specialist (which was never on my wish list) The specialist was great and very sensitive in dealing with me. She explained that the signalling system from bowel to brain is compromised, so the message to ""go"" is not received until nearly too late.  She suggested trying Peristeen, this is a self administered sort of enema. By putting water into the lower bowel it increases pressure to tissue which then sends signals to the brain to let go of the rubbish. This might sound bizarre but it enables me to be pretty confident that I will not get caught out. So before appointments or meetings with friends I can take a bit of control and comfortable about going out.  You are right, it is not the greatest subject of conversation, but with the right support it should not restrict your life.  I hope you can get something to help you out as well.

998,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI,"   The brain    The brain has three main parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum and the brain stem. The cerebrum is the big part on the top which most people think of as the brain. The cerebellum is the smaller, roundish part that lies underneath the back of the cerebrum. The brain stem is the part that joins the brain to the spinal cord. It lies underneath the cerebrum, in front of the cerebellum and is at the top of the spinal cord.  The brain has three main types of matter, i.e. stuff. Gray matter is the stuff that does all the processing, encoding and storage  basically the thinking. White matter is the stuff that carries the signals between different parts of gray matter. If you imagine your phone connected to your computer via a USB cable, the phone and the computer are different parts of gray matter and the USB cable is the white matter allowing them to communicate with each other. Gray and white matter are made up of billions of neurons, or nerves: gray matter contains the main bodies of the nerves and white matter contains the tails of the nerves, called axons. Nerves that need to transmit fast signals have a myelin coating on their axons.  The third type of matter is CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). It bathes the brain, cushioning it and providing nourishment. There are reservoirs of CSF in the brain, the contents of which are continually refreshed by our bodies. These reservoirs are called ventricles. The biggest of these are called the lateral ventricles. If you slice the head from the eyes to the back of the skull and look down at it, you will see the lateral ventricles, one on either side of the line down the middle of the cerebrum, looking a bit like a butterfly.  Humans have evolved to have a lot of brain matter, so the only way to fit it all into the skull is to squeeze it together, like squishing up a piece of cloth to fit it into a tight space. This means that the cerebrum has lots of folds in it. The bits that go in are called sulci (a single sulci is called a sulcus) and the bits that go out are called gyri (a single gyri is called a gyrus) and they all have names. [Mammals that arent as intelligent as humans have smoother cerebrums, with fewer sulci and gyri, if any.]  The cerebrum has two halves, or hemispheres, which are approximate mirror images of each other. They are joined only by some tracts of white matter (like a bunch of USB cables instead of just one), so the two halves can work together. The main tract of white matter joining the two hemispheres is called the corpus callosum. It is in the middle of the cerebrum, next to the lateral ventricles. If you cut the corpus callosum, the left side and right side of the cerebrum cannot communicate properly. It is quite common for people with MS to have lesions on the corpus callosum. (A lesion is an area of damage or abnormality.)  The cerebrum is split into four lobes (areas): frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital. Because the cerebrum has two halves, there are right and left frontal lobes, right and left parietal lobes, etc. The frontal lobe is more or less the front half of the cerebrum. It stops at the central sulcus. The parietal and temporal lobes lie behind the frontal lobe with the parietal lobe at the top of the head and the temporal lobes at the sides, more or less behind your ears. The occipital lobe is right at the back. The frontal lobe is important for personality, working memory, decision making, controlling inhibition, movement, etc. The parietal lobe is important for sensation, maths, music, humour, spatial tasks, etc. The temporal lobe is important for hearing, memory, language, emotions, object recognition, etc. The occipital lobe is dedicated to vision.  The outer layers of the cerebrum are made up of gray matter. Together, these layers are called the cortex or cerebral cortex. Anything to do with the cortex is referred to as cortical. (Anything to do with the cerebrum is called cerebral and anything to do with the cerebellum is called cerebellar.) White matter lying close to the cortex is called subcortical (or superficial). White matter lying deeper into the brain is called deep white matter. There is also deep gray matter, found in the centre of the brain and the brain stem as well as white and gray matter in the spinal cord.  Amongst other things, the cerebellum is important for making all kinds of movement smooth, for balance and for learning new motor skills. The brain stem is important for many fundamental functions like sleeping, breathing and heart rate. Many of the cranial nerves come from the brain stem, controlling things like eye movements, sensation and movement of the face, mouth and tongue, and swallowing.  In general, the left side of the cerebrum controls the right side of the body and vice versa. This is not the case in the cerebellum where the right side controls the right side of the body and the left, the left. All the nerves from the cerebrum and the cerebellum go through the brain stem to get to the spinal cord. The cerebral nerves cross in the brain stem so that the right side of the spinal cord controls the right side of the body and the left, the left. This means that a problem with the right side of the body might come from a left hemisphere cerebral lesion, a right hemisphere cerebellar lesion, the left or right side of the brain stem (depending on whether it is above or below where the nerves cross) or a lesion on the right hand side of the spinal cord.  The McDonald criteria stipulate that, to be diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS, patients need to have at least two attacks and at least one lesion in at least two of four specified areas of the central nervous system: three in the brain and one in the spinal cord. (You can download the full paper for free: its Polman et al. Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria. ANN NEUROL 2011; 69:292-302.) The criteria for primary progressive MS are a gradual progression of symptoms (normally of at least a years duration) and two of the following: a positive lumbar puncture, at least two spinal cord lesions, at least one lesion in at least one of the three specified brain areas.   The three brain areas in the McDonald criteria are juxtacortical, periventricular and infratentorial. Juxtacortical means next to / into the cortex, i.e. a lesion that lies right at the border of the gray and white matter close to the outer edge of the cerebrum. Periventricular means next to the ventricles. Lesions next to the lateral ventricles are very common in MS. They often form at right angles to the ventricles which, when looked at side on, look a bit like fingers poking up over a wall. These are called Dawsons fingers and are a classic sign of MS. Infratentorial means the brain stem and cerebellum; the areas under the cerebrum.  There are some parts of the cortex that are named after what they do. The most obvious of these are the visual cortex, the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. The visual cortex is the cortex in the occipital lobe; the gray matter that makes sense of all the information that your eyes gather. The motor cortex is the last gyri of the frontal lobe, the precentral gyrus. It is in charge of movement. The somatosensory cortex is the first gyri of the parietal lobe, the postcentral gyrus. It is on the other side of the central sulcus to the motor cortex and it controls sensation in your body. If you put your hands loosely on both ears, your thumbs are pointing towards your visual cortex, your left and right ring fingers are pointing roughly towards your left and right motor cortices and your middle fingers are pointing roughly towards your somatosensory cortices.  Finally, a few terms that you might come across:    -  Anterior: in front; towards the front of the brain    -  Posterior: behind; towards the back of the brain   -  Superior: above; towards the top of the brain   - Inferior: below; towards the spinal cord   -  Horn/tip: refers to the ends of the lateral ventricles; the wing tips of the butterfly shape. ","<p><strong><u>The brain</u></strong></p><p>The brain has three main parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum and the brain stem. The cerebrum is the big part on the top which most people think of as the brain. The cerebellum is the smaller, roundish part that lies underneath the back of the cerebrum. The brain stem is the part that joins the brain to the spinal cord. It lies underneath the cerebrum, in front of the cerebellum and is at the top of the spinal cord.</p><p>The brain has three main types of matter, i.e. stuff. Gray matter is the stuff that does all the processing, encoding and storage  basically the thinking. White matter is the stuff that carries the signals between different parts of gray matter. If you imagine your phone connected to your computer via a USB cable, the phone and the computer are different parts of gray matter and the USB cable is the white matter allowing them to communicate with each other. Gray and white matter are made up of billions of neurons, or nerves: gray matter contains the main bodies of the nerves and white matter contains the tails of the nerves, called axons. Nerves that need to transmit fast signals have a myelin coating on their axons.</p><p>The third type of matter is CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). It bathes the brain, cushioning it and providing nourishment. There are reservoirs of CSF in the brain, the contents of which are continually refreshed by our bodies. These reservoirs are called ventricles. The biggest of these are called the lateral ventricles. If you slice the head from the eyes to the back of the skull and look down at it, you will see the lateral ventricles, one on either side of the line down the middle of the cerebrum, looking a bit like a butterfly.</p><p>Humans have evolved to have a lot of brain matter, so the only way to fit it all into the skull is to squeeze it together, like squishing up a piece of cloth to fit it into a tight space. This means that the cerebrum has lots of folds in it. The bits that go in are called sulci (a single sulci is called a sulcus) and the bits that go out are called gyri (a single gyri is called a gyrus) and they all have names. [Mammals that arent as intelligent as humans have smoother cerebrums, with fewer sulci and gyri, if any.]</p><p>The cerebrum has two halves, or hemispheres, which are approximate mirror images of each other. They are joined only by some tracts of white matter (like a bunch of USB cables instead of just one), so the two halves can work together. The main tract of white matter joining the two hemispheres is called the corpus callosum. It is in the middle of the cerebrum, next to the lateral ventricles. If you cut the corpus callosum, the left side and right side of the cerebrum cannot communicate properly. It is quite common for people with MS to have lesions on the corpus callosum. (A lesion is an area of damage or abnormality.)</p><p>The cerebrum is split into four lobes (areas): frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital. Because the cerebrum has two halves, there are right and left frontal lobes, right and left parietal lobes, etc. The frontal lobe is more or less the front half of the cerebrum. It stops at the central sulcus. The parietal and temporal lobes lie behind the frontal lobe with the parietal lobe at the top of the head and the temporal lobes at the sides, more or less behind your ears. The occipital lobe is right at the back. The frontal lobe is important for personality, working memory, decision making, controlling inhibition, movement, etc. The parietal lobe is important for sensation, maths, music, humour, spatial tasks, etc. The temporal lobe is important for hearing, memory, language, emotions, object recognition, etc. The occipital lobe is dedicated to vision.</p><p>The outer layers of the cerebrum are made up of gray matter. Together, these layers are called the cortex or cerebral cortex. Anything to do with the cortex is referred to as cortical. (Anything to do with the cerebrum is called cerebral and anything to do with the cerebellum is called cerebellar.) White matter lying close to the cortex is called subcortical (or superficial). White matter lying deeper into the brain is called deep white matter. There is also deep gray matter, found in the centre of the brain and the brain stem as well as white and gray matter in the spinal cord.</p><p>Amongst other things, the cerebellum is important for making all kinds of movement smooth, for balance and for learning new motor skills. The brain stem is important for many fundamental functions like sleeping, breathing and heart rate. Many of the cranial nerves come from the brain stem, controlling things like eye movements, sensation and movement of the face, mouth and tongue, and swallowing.</p><p>In general, the left side of the cerebrum controls the right side of the body and vice versa. This is not the case in the cerebellum where the right side controls the right side of the body and the left, the left. All the nerves from the cerebrum and the cerebellum go through the brain stem to get to the spinal cord. The cerebral nerves cross in the brain stem so that the right side of the spinal cord controls the right side of the body and the left, the left. This means that a problem with the right side of the body might come from a left hemisphere cerebral lesion, a right hemisphere cerebellar lesion, the left or right side of the brain stem (depending on whether it is above or below where the nerves cross) or a lesion on the right hand side of the spinal cord.</p><p>The McDonald criteria stipulate that, to be diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS, patients need to have at least two attacks and at least one lesion in at least two of four specified areas of the central nervous system: three in the brain and one in the spinal cord. (You can download the full paper for free: its Polman et al. Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria. ANN NEUROL 2011; 69:292-302.) The criteria for primary progressive MS are a gradual progression of symptoms (normally of at least a years duration) and two of the following: a positive lumbar puncture, at least two spinal cord lesions, at least one lesion in at least one of the three specified brain areas. </p><p>The three brain areas in the McDonald criteria are juxtacortical, periventricular and infratentorial. Juxtacortical means next to / into the cortex, i.e. a lesion that lies right at the border of the gray and white matter close to the outer edge of the cerebrum. Periventricular means next to the ventricles. Lesions next to the lateral ventricles are very common in MS. They often form at right angles to the ventricles which, when looked at side on, look a bit like fingers poking up over a wall. These are called Dawsons fingers and are a classic sign of MS. Infratentorial means the brain stem and cerebellum; the areas under the cerebrum.</p><p>There are some parts of the cortex that are named after what they do. The most obvious of these are the visual cortex, the motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex. The visual cortex is the cortex in the occipital lobe; the gray matter that makes sense of all the information that your eyes gather. The motor cortex is the last gyri of the frontal lobe, the precentral gyrus. It is in charge of movement. The somatosensory cortex is the first gyri of the parietal lobe, the postcentral gyrus. It is on the other side of the central sulcus to the motor cortex and it controls sensation in your body. If you put your hands loosely on both ears, your thumbs are pointing towards your visual cortex, your left and right ring fingers are pointing roughly towards your left and right motor cortices and your middle fingers are pointing roughly towards your somatosensory cortices.</p><p>Finally, a few terms that you might come across:</p><p><span><strong>- </strong>Anterior: in front; towards the front of the brain</span></p><p><strong>-</strong> Posterior: behind; towards the back of the brain</p><p><strong>-</strong> Superior: above; towards the top of the brain</p><p><strong>-</strong>Inferior: below; towards the spinal cord</p><p><strong>- </strong>Horn/tip: refers to the ends of the lateral ventricles; the wing tips of the butterfly shape.</p>",23 Aug  2011 at 10:47 am,#2,104597,https://community.mssociety.org.uk/comment/104597#comment-104597,,,,,,,

1001,A brief beginner's guide to the brain and MRI,"   MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging    When you have an MRI scanning session, they run a number of different scans. The standard ones, that are run for pretty much all medical conditions, are called T1 and T2. Scan types are constantly being developed, but the most commonly used additional scan type for MS investigations is FLAIR. You will also hear of PD, FSE, STIR, DWI and others, but Im not covering them here.  The way MRI works is that different types of matter give off different levels of energy when they are placed in a magnetic field. The computer slices the thing being scanned and collects the energy signal from one slice at a time. Because of some of the loud banging noises the scanner makes, it can also work out the signal from small cubes of each slice. These cubes are called voxels (short for volume pixels).  Each slice provides the information for one image and each voxel provides the information for one pixel in that image. The whole process uses some very advanced mathematics, but ultimately, the higher the overall signal from a voxel, the brighter the pixel is on the final image (and the lower the signal, the darker the pixel). This is where the terminology gray and white matter is less than helpful so bear with me!  In a T1 scan, gray matter gives off a low signal and looks darker in the images than white matter which gives off a higher signal and looks pale gray. CSF meanwhile gives off the lowest signal and looks black. Everything is reversed in a T2 scan: gray matter looks pale gray, white matter looks darker gray and CSF looks white. FLAIR is a clever adjustment of a T2 scan which suppresses the signal from CSF. This means that we end up with gray matter looking pale gray, white matter looking darker gray and CSF looking black.  Different lesions give off different signals too. In general, a white matter MS lesion gives off a high signal in T2 and FLAIR scans, leading to it looking like a white spot against the white matter which looks relatively dark in these scan types. T1 is usually rubbish for spotting MS lesions unless the lesion has caused the area to die, or atrophy, in which case it is called a black hole  because it is a wee black hole on a T1 image. The terms hyperintensity, hyperintense, high signal, etc, all refer to the fact that somewhere is brighter / whiter than it should be. Hypointensity, hypointense area, etc, refers to somewhere that is darker than it should be. Exactly what relevance these have depends on their size, shape, location and the type of scan though.  Remember that I mentioned CSF bathes the brain? That means that all the sulci of the brain are full of CSF and so there is a lot of white on T2 images. Spotting a lesion in amongst lots of perfectly normal white stuff can be tricky, however it is really quite easy in FLAIR images  because there shouldnt be very much white; all the CSF is black. (Please note that some small white spots can be perfectly normal  they are usually blood vessels.)  Sometimes, neuros ask for a scan with contrast. This is a T1 scan taken after the patient has been injected with a contrast agent. This is usually gadolinium which looks bright white on a T1 scan. The central nervous system, i.e. the brain and spinal cord, is protected by the blood brain barrier (bbb) which stops things that might harm it from getting in; gadolinium normally cant get through the bbb.  In MS, cells from the immune system get through the bbb and attack the myelin coating of nerves in that area, causing inflammation and damage: a lesion. While this is happening, the lesion is called active, enhancing or contrast enhancing. The gap the immune system has caused in the bbb allows gadolinium to get in. If there are no breaches in the bbb, there should be no bright white signs of gadolinium inside the brain or spinal cord. If there are, these show where there are breaches, in other words, where the immune system is actively causing new damage.  Contrast is used for two main reasons: to show up very new lesions (typically lesions newer than about six weeks) because these can be difficult to see on normal MRI and to help show which lesions are active and which are not as this can be important for deciding on meds. Newer types of scans, e.g. DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) which measures water flow, can be used to do this too so contrast is being used less often these days.  Some terms you might come across:    -  Sagittal: images taken from ear to ear, parallel to the nose     -   Axial: images taken from front to back, at right angles to the nose    -  Coronal: images taken from the front to back, parallel to the nose and so that one slice goes through both ears   -  Artefact/artifact: a computer error, nothing to worry about   -  1.5T (and other numbers followed by a T): This is scanner strength, i.e. how strong the magnetic field is that the scanner produces. The T is short for Tesla, but has nothing to do with the T in T1 and T2 scans.  Most NHS scanners are 1.5T. There are a few 3T (and stronger) scanners that are much more powerful than 1.5T scanners, but these are usually run by Universities. Do not assume that private MRI scanners (or scans) are better than NHS scanners (or scans)  they are mostly the same, but can be worse.  For those of you who arent quite brain dead yet(!)...  Partial volume effects are an important factor in how good a scan is and are particularly relevant if you are told your MRI is clear or you have no new lesions when you are having new symptoms. Remember that the computer slices up whatevers being scanned and then splits the slices into little cubes, the signal from these determining how dark or light a pixel will be in the image? Well, the size of those cubes has a major effect. Imagine a voxel that only contains white matter.  In a T2 scan, that voxel will give a low signal and the resultant pixel will look dark gray. Now imagine a voxel that is mostly white matter, but also has a bit of a lesion in it. In a T2 scan, lesions give high signals, so the pixel will now look brighter than the last one. But by how much? If its a small voxel and the lesion provides a decent proportion of the signal, the pixel will be obviously brighter than its neighbour and a radiologist should spot it easily.  However, if its a big voxel, the extra signal from the lesion might only make the pixel a wee bit paler than its neighbour and make it very easy to miss. So, the moral of the story: its important to have thin slices and small voxels! 3mm slices are fine. Less than that is great, more than that and you are losing a lot of definition and increasing the chances of missing small lesions.  By the time you get to 6mm and thicker, you could miss average and even bigger than average lesions too. (The average MS lesion is 7mm.) The slice thickness is not usually written in reports or on images, but the number of images is the same as the number of slices so the greater the number of images in one scan, the thinner the slices.  The best images generally come from thin slices with small voxels on a stronger scanner, but small voxels on a 1.5T scanner will be better than big voxels on a 3T scanner every time.

1002,Your first symptoms - looking back..," My first symptom that was ""MS-like"" was tingling in my hands and feet. My situation is complicated because I have had a positive blood test for Lyme Disease. The first symptom of that was feeling fluey and having excruciating headaches. The early tingling I had may have been caused by Lyme, but its also possible that Lyme caused my MS symptoms or that it caused an immune response that gave me MS type symptoms. Or its possible that the two things are unrelated, though I find this less likely - what are the odds? All my doctors treat it as unrelated though, so I just have to go with that just now.  The next symptom I noticed was that the skin round my right side felt rubbery and numb when I touched it. Then I got muscle spasms round my rib cage which were very painful. I still get those. I like to say that at least it's a good work out. I have abs of steel!   But it is sore and it always makes me feel oppressed and grumpy when I'm sitting at my desk at work feeling like there's an anaconda wrapped around my middle.

1003,Your first symptoms - looking back.., Thank you Space Monkey. I belive the tingling is a usual first presentation. Might be wrong. Hence why I am not sure I have MS. I get tingling but not for long and not often. I haven't gone numb anywhere apart from at night and I don't know if that counts? Cause I am thinking it is to do with my sleep. It's every second night and my arm/shoulder will go completely numb that its dangling and I am hitting it to try and get feeling back - oh does tingle when the feeling is disappearing and then as it appears again. Ive had this in my leg as well. But more often in my arm. But always at night. So I just don't know.  Awful you have Lyme as well. Ive read a little about that and believe it can totally drain you. That must be hard work dealing with both. I feel for you. It's great though - that you are working? I imagine it's a struggle but you should be proud of yourself for keeping that up. ,<p>Thank you Space Monkey. I belive the tingling is a usual first presentation. Might be wrong.
